<h1>PRISONERS OF CONSCIENCE</h1>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span><a id='link_1'></a>I<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE WEAVING OF DOOM</span></h2>

<p>In the early part of this century there lived
at Lerwick, in the Shetland Islands, a
man called Liot Borson. He was no
ignoble man; through sea-fishers and
sea-fighters he counted his forefathers
in an unbroken line back to the great Norwegian Bor,
while his own life was full of perilous labor and he
was off to sea every day that a boat could swim. Liot
was the outcome of the most vivid and masterful form
of paganism and the most vital and uncompromising
form of Christianity. For nearly eight hundred years
the Borsons had been christened, but who can deliver
a man from his ancestors? Bor still spoke to his son
through the stirring stories of the sagas, and Liot
knew the lives of Thord and Odd, of Gisli and the
banded men, and the tremendous drama of Nial and
his sons, just as well as he knew the histories of the
prophets and heroes of his Old Testament. It is true
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
that he held the former with a kind of reservation, and
that he gave to the latter a devout and passionate faith,
but this faith was not always potential. There were
hours in Liot&#8217;s life when he was still a pagan, when he
approved the swift, personal vengeance which Odin
enjoined and Christ forbade&#8211;hours in which he felt
himself to be the son of the man who had carried his
gods and his home to uninhabited Iceland rather than
take cross-marking for the meek and lowly Jesus.</p>

<p>In his youth&#8211;before his great sorrow came to him&#8211;he
had but little trouble from this subcharacter.
Of all the men in Lerwick, he knew best the king
stories and the tellings-up of the ancients; and when
the boats with bare spars rocked idly on the summer
seas waiting for the shoal, or the men and women were
gathered together to pass the long winter nights, Liot
was eagerly sought after. Then, as the women knit
and the men sat with their hands clasped upon their
heads, Liot stood in their midst and told of the wayfarings
and doings of the Borsons, who had been in
the Varangian Guard, and sometimes of the sad doom
of his fore-elder Gisli, who had been cursed even before
he was born.</p>

<p>He did not often speak of Gisli; for the man ruled
him across the gulf of centuries, and he was always
unhappy when he gave way to the temptation to do
so; for he could not get rid of the sense of kinship
with him, nor of the memory of that withering spaedom
with which the first Gisli had been cursed by the
wronged thrall who slew him&#8211;&#8220;<i>This is but the beginning
of the ill luck which I will bring on thy kith and kin
after thee.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>Never had he felt the brooding gloom of this
wretched heirship so vividly as on the night when he
first met Karen Sabiston. Karen lived with her aunt
Matilda Sabiston, the richest woman in Lerwick and
the chief pillar of the kirk and its societies. On that
night the best knitters in Lerwick were gathered at
her house, knitting the fine, lace-like shawls which
were to be sold at the next foy for some good cause
which the minister should approve. They were weary
of their own talk, and longing for Liot to come and
tell them a story. And some of the young girls whispered
to Karen, &#8220;When Liot Borson opens the door,
then you will see the handsomest man in the islands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have seen fine men in Yell and Unst,&#8221; answered
Karen; &#8220;I think I shall see no handsomer ones in Lerwick.
Is he fair or dark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a straight-faced, bright-faced man, tall and
strong, who can tell a story so that you will be carried
off your feet and away wherever he chooses to take you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have done always as Karen Sabiston was minded
to do; and now I will not be moved this way or that
way as some one else minds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that we shall see.&#8221; And as Thora Glumm
spoke Liot came into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;The wind is blowing dead on shore, and the sea is
like a man gone out of his wits,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>And Matilda answered, &#8220;Well, then, Liot, come to
the fire.&#8221; And as they went toward the fire she stopped
before a lovely girl and said, &#8220;Look, now, this is my
niece Karen; she has just come from Yell, and she can
tell a story also; so it will be, which can better the
other.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>Then Liot looked at Karen, and the girl looked up
at him; in that instant their souls remembered each
other. They put their hands together like old lovers,
and if Liot had drawn her to his heart and kissed her
Karen would not have been much astonished. This
sweet reciprocity was, however, so personal that onlookers
did not see it, and so swift that Liot appeared
to answer promptly enough:</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a good thing for us all if we should
hear a new story. As for me, the game is up. I can
think of nothing to-night but my poor kinsman Gisli,
and he was not a lucky man, nor is it lucky to speak
of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it Gisli you are talking about?&#8221; asked Wolf
Skegg. &#8220;Let us bring the man among us; I like him
best of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had much sorrow,&#8221; said Andrew Grimm.</p>

<p>&#8220;He had a good wife,&#8221; answered Gust Havard; &#8220;and
not many men are so lucky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas his fate,&#8221; stammered a very old man, crouching
over the fire, &#8220;and in everything fate rules.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, Snorro, fate is justice,&#8221; said Matilda;
&#8220;and as well begin, Liot, for it will be the tale of
Gisli and no other&#8211;I see that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Liot stood up, and Karen, busy with her knitting,
watched him. She saw that he had brown hair
and gray eyes and the fearless carriage of one who is
at home on the North Sea. His voice at first was
frank and full of brave inflections, as he told of the
noble, faithful, helpful Gisli, pursued by evil fortune
even in his dreams. Gradually its tones became sad
as the complaining of the sea, and a brooding melancholy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
touched every heart as Gisli, doing all he might
do to ward off misfortune, found it of no avail. &#8220;For
what must be must be; there is no help for it,&#8221; sighed
Liot. &#8220;So, then, love of wife and friends, and all that
good-will dared, could not help Gisli, for the man was
doomed even before his birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he paused, and there was a dead silence and
an unmistakable sense of expectation; and Liot&#8217;s face
changed, and he looked as Gisli might have looked
when he knew that he had come to his last fight for
life. Also for a moment his eyes rested on old Snorro,
who was no longer crouching over the hearth, but
straight up and full of fire and interest; and Snorro
answered the look with a nod, that meant something
which all approved and understood; after which Liot
continued in a voice full of a somber passion:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the very last night of the summer, and neither
Gisli nor his true wife, Auda, could sleep. Gisli
had bad dreams full of fate if he shut his eyes, and
he knew that his life-days were nearly over. So they
left their house and went to a hiding-place among the
crags, and no sooner were they there than they heard
the voice of their enemy Eyjolf, and there were fourteen
men with him. &#8216;Come on like men,&#8217; shouted Gisli,
&#8216;for I am not going to fare farther away.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then old Snorro raised himself and answered Liot
in the very words of Eyjolf:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Lay down the good arms thou bearest, and give
up also Auda, thy wife.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come and take them like a man, for neither the
arms I bear nor the wife I love are fit for any one
else!&#8217;&#8221; cried Liot, in reply. And this challenge and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
valiant answer, though fully expected, charged the
crowded room with enthusiasm. The women let their
knitting fall and sat with parted lips and shining
eyes, and the men looked at Liot as men look whose
hands are on their weapons.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; continued Liot, &#8220;the men made for the crags;
but Gisli fought like a hero, and in that bout four men
were slain. And when they were least aware Gisli
leaped on a crag, that stands alone there and is called
Oneman&#8217;s Crag, and there he turned at bay and called
out to Eyjolf, &#8216;I wish to make those three hundred in
silver, which thou hast taken as the price of my head,
as dear bought as I can; and before we part thou
wouldst give other three hundred in silver that we had
never met; for thou wilt only take disgrace for loss
of life.&#8217; Then their onslaught was harder and hotter,
and they gave Gisli many spear-thrusts; but he fought
on wondrously, and there was not one of them without
a wound who came nigh him. At last, full of
great hurts, Gisli bade them wait awhile and they
should have the end they wanted; for he would have
time to sing this last song to his faithful Auda:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&#8216;Wife, so fair, so never-failing,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So truly loved, so sorely cross&#8217;d,</p>
<p>Thou wilt often miss me, wailing;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou wilt weep thy hero lost.</p>
<p>But my heart is stout as ever;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Swords may bite, I feel no smart;</p>
<p>Father! better heirloom never</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Owned thy son than fearless heart.&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And with these words he rushed down from the crag
and clove Thord&#8211;who was Eyjolf&#8217;s kinsman&#8211;to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
very belt. There Gisli lost his life with many great
and sore wounds. He never turned his heel, and
none of them saw that his strokes were lighter, the
last than the first. They buried him by the sea, and
at his grave the sixth man breathed his last; and on
the same night the seventh man breathed his last;
and an eighth lay bedridden for twelve months and
died. And though the rest were healed, they got nothing
but shame for their pains. Thus Gisli came to his
grave; and it has always been said, by one and all,
that there never was a more famous defense made by
one man in any time, of which the truth is known; but
he was not lucky in anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will doubt that,&#8221; said Gust Havard. &#8220;He had
Auda to wife, and never was there a woman more
beautiful and loving and faithful. He had love-luck,
if he had no other luck. God give us all such wives
as Auda!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; answered Matilda, &#8220;a man&#8217;s fate is
his wife, and she is of his own choosing; and, what is
more, a good husband makes a good wife.&#8221; Then,
suddenly stopping, she listened a moment and added:
&#8220;The minister is come, and we shall hear from him
still better words. But sit down, Liot; you have
passed the hour well, as you always do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The minister came in with a smile, and he was
placed in the best chair and made many times welcome.
It was evident in a moment that he had brought
a different spirit with him; the old world vanished
away, and the men and women that a few minutes
before had been so close to it suffered a transformation.
As the minister entered the room they became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
in a moment members of the straitest Christian kirk&#8211;quiet,
hard-working fishers, and douce, home-keeping
women. He said the night was bad and black, and
spoke of the boats and the fishers in them. And the
men talked solemnly about the &#8220;takes&#8221; and the kirk
meetings, while some of the women knitted and listened,
and others helped Matilda and Karen to set the table
with goose and fish, and barley and oaten cakes, and the
hot, sweet tea which is the Shetlander&#8217;s favorite drink.</p>

<p>Many meals in a lifetime people eat, and few are
remembered; but when they are &#8220;eventful,&#8221; how sweet
or bitter is that bread-breaking! This night Liot&#8217;s
cake and fish and cup of tea were as angels&#8217; food.
Karen broke her cake with him, and she sweetened
his cup, and smiled at him and talked to him as he
ate and drank with her. And when at last they stood
up for the song and thanksgiving he held her hand in
his, and their voices blended in the noble sea psalm,
so dear to every seafarer&#8217;s heart:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;The floods, O Lord, have lifted up,</p>
<p>They lifted up their voice!</p>
<p>The floods have lifted up their waves</p>
<p>And made a mighty noise.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;But yet the Lord, that is on high,</p>
<p>Is more of might by far</p>
<p>Than noise of many waters is,</p>
<p>Or great sea-billows are.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Soft and loud the singing swelled, and the short
thanksgiving followed it. To bend his head and hold
Karen&#8217;s hand while the blessing fell on his ears was
heaven on earth to Liot; such happiness he had never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
known before&#8211;never even dreamed of. He walked
home through the buffeting wind and the drenching
rain, and felt neither; for he was saying over and
over to himself, &#8220;I have found my wife! I have found
my wife!&#8221;</p>

<p>Karen had the same prepossession. As she unbound
her long, fair hair she thought of Liot. Slowly unplaiting
strand from strand, she murmured to her heart as
she did so:</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a man as Liot Borson I have never met before.
It was easy to see that he loved me as soon as
he looked at me; well, then, Liot Borson shall be my
husband&#8211;Liot, and only Liot, will I marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was at the beginning of winter that this took
place, and it was a kind of new birth to Liot. Hitherto
he had been a silent man about his work; he now
began to talk and to sing, and even to whistle; and,
as every one knows, whistling is the most cheerful
sound that comes from human lips. People wondered
a little and said, &#8220;It is Karen Sabiston, and it is a
good thing.&#8221; Also, the doubts and fears that usually
trouble the beginnings of love were absent in this
case. Wherever Liot and Karen had learned each
other, the lesson had been perfected. At their third
meeting he asked her to be his wife, and she answered
with simple honesty, &#8220;That is my desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>This betrothal was, however, far from satisfactory
to Karen&#8217;s aunt; she could bring up nothing against
Liot, but she was ill pleased with Karen. &#8220;You have
some beauty,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and you have one hundred
pounds of your own; and it was to be expected that
you would look to better yourself a little.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>&#8220;Have I not done so? Liot is the best of men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the best of men are but men at best. It is
not of Liot I think, but of Liot&#8217;s money; he is but
poor, and you know little of him. Those before us
have said wisely, &#8216;Ere you run in double harness, look
well to the other horse.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart tells me that I have done right, aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your heart cannot foretell, but you might have
sense enough to forethink; and it is sure that I little
dreamed of this when I brought you here from the
naked gloom of Yell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true your word brought me here, but I think
it was Liot who called me by you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not. When my tongue speaks for any Borson,
I wish that it may speak no more! I like none
of them. Liot is good at need on a winter&#8217;s night; but
even so, all his stories are of dool and wrong-doing
and bloody vengeance. From his own words it is seen
that the Borsons have ever been well-hated men. Now,
I have forty years more of this life than you have, and
I tell you plainly I think little of your choice; whatever
sorrow comes of it, mind this: I didn&#8217;t give you
leave to make it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor did I ask your leave, aunt; each heart knows
its own; but you have a way to throw cold water upon
every hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are hopes I wish at the bottom of the sea.
To be sure, when ill is fated some one must speak the
words that bring it about; but I wish it had been any
other but myself who wrote, &#8216;Come to Lerwick&#8217;;
for I little thought I was writing, &#8216;Come to Liot
Borson.&#8217; As every one knows, he is the son of unlucky
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
folk; from father to son nothing goes well
with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will put my luck to his, and you will learn to
think better of Liot for my sake, aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not while my life-days last! That is a naked say,
and there&#8217;s no more to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Matilda&#8217;s dislike, however, did not seriously interfere
with Liot&#8217;s and Karen&#8217;s happiness. It was more
passive than active; it was more virulent when he was
absent than when he was present; and all winter she
suffered him to visit at her house. These visits had
various fortunes, but, good or bad, the season wore
away with them; and as soon as April came Liot began
to build his house. Matilda scoffed at his hurry.
&#8220;Does he think,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;that he can marry Karen
Sabiston when he lists to? Till you are twenty-one
you are in my charge, and I will take care to prevent
such folly as long as I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, aunt, I shall be of age and my own
mistress next Christmas, and on Uphellya night<a id='FNanchor_1'></a><a href='#Footnote_1' class='fnanchor'><sup>[1]</sup></a> I
will be married to Liot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After that we shall have nothing to say to each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not be my fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be my will. However, if you are in love
with ill luck and fated for Liot Borson, you must dree
your destiny; and Liot does well to build his home,
for he shall not wive himself out of my walls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be more shame to you than to me, aunt, if
I am not married from your house; also, people will
speak evil of you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>&#8220;That is to be expected; but I will not be so ill to
myself as to make a feast for a man I hate. However,
there are eight months before Uphellya, and many
chances and changes may come in eight months.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were a prophecy. As Matilda uttered
them Thora Fay entered the room, all aglow with excitement.
&#8220;There is a new ship in the harbor!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;She is called the <i>Frigate Bird</i>, and she has
silk and linen and gold ornaments for sale, besides
tea and coffee and the finest of spirits. As for the
captain, he is as handsome as can be, and my brother
thinks him a man of some account.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bring good news, Thora,&#8221; said Matilda. &#8220;I
would gladly see the best of whatever is for sale, and
I wish your brother to let so much come to the man&#8217;s
ears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will look to that,&#8221; answered Thora. &#8220;Every one
knows there is to be a wedding in your house very
soon.&#8221; And with these words she nodded at Karen,
and went smiling away with her message.</p>

<p>A few hours afterward Captain Bele Trenby of
the <i>Frigate Bird</i> stepped across Matilda Sabiston&#8217;s
threshold. It was the first step toward his death-place,
though he knew it not; he took it with a laugh
and a saucy compliment to the pretty servant who
opened the door for him, and with the air of one accustomed
to being welcome went into Matilda Sabiston&#8217;s
presence. He delighted the proud, wilful old
woman as soon as she saw him; his black eyes and
curling black hair, the dare-devil look on his face, and
the fearless dash of his manner reminded her of Paul
Sabiston, the husband of her youth. She opened her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
heart and her purse to the bold free-trader; she made
him eat and drink, and with a singular imprudence
told him of secret ways in and out of the voes, and
of hiding-places in the coast caverns that had been
known to her husband. And as she talked she grew
handsome; so much so that Karen let her knitting
fall to watch her aunt&#8217;s face as she described Paul
Sabiston&#8217;s swift cutter&#8211;&#8220;a mass of snowy canvas,
stealing in and out of the harbor like a cloud.&#8221;</p>

<p>The coming of this man was the beginning of sorrow.
In a few days he understood the situation, and
he resolved to marry Karen Sabiston. Her fair, stately
beauty charmed him, and he had no doubt she would
inherit her aunt&#8217;s wealth; that she was cold and shy
only stimulated his love, and as for Liot, he held his
pretensions in contempt. All summer he sailed between
Holland and Shetland, and the Lerwick people
gave him good trade and good welcome. With Matilda
Sabiston he had his own way; she did whatever he
wished her to do. Only at Karen her power stopped
short; neither promises nor threats would induce the
girl to accept Bele as her lover; and Matilda, accustomed
to drive her will through the teeth of every
one, was angry morning, noon, and night with her
disobedient niece.</p>

<p>As the months wore on Liot&#8217;s position became more
and more painful and humiliating, and he had hard
work to keep his hands off Bele when they met on the
pier or in the narrow streets of the town. His smile,
his voice, his face, his showy dress and hectoring manner,
all fed in Liot&#8217;s heart that bitter hatred which
springs from a sense of being personally held in contempt;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
he felt, also, that even among his fellow-townsmen
he was belittled and injured by this plausible,
handsome stranger. For Bele said very much what
it pleased him to say, covering his insolences with a
laugh and with a jovial, jocular air, that made resentment
seem ridiculous. Bele was also a gift-giver, and
for every woman, old or young, he had a compliment
or a ribbon.</p>

<p>If Liot had been less human, if he had come from
a more mixed race, if his feelings had been educated
down and toned to the level of modern culture, he
could possibly have looked forward to Uphellya night,
and found in the joy and triumph that Karen would
then give him a sufficient set-off to all Bele&#8217;s injuries and
impertinences. But he was not made thus; his very
blood came to him through the hearts of vikings and
berserkers, and as long as one drop of this fierce stream
remained in his veins, moments were sure to come in
the which it would render all the tide of life insurgent.</p>

<p>It is true Liot was a Christian and a good man; but
it must be noted, in order to do him full justice, that
the form of Christianity which was finally and passionately
accepted by his race was that of ultra-Calvinism;
it spoke to their inherited tendencies as no other creed
could have done. This uncompromising theology,
with its God of vengeance and inflexible justice, was
understood by men who considered a blood-feud of
centuries a duty never to be neglected; and as for the
doctrine of a special election, with all its tremendous
possibilities of damnation, they were not disposed to
object to it. Indeed, they were such good haters that
Tophet and everlasting enmity were the bane and doom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
they would have unhesitatingly chosen for their enemies.
This grim theology Liot sucked in with his
mother&#8217;s milk, and both by inheritance and by a strong
personal faith he was a child of God after the order of
John Calvin.</p>

<p>Therefore he constantly brought his enemy to the
ultimate and immutable tribunal of his faith, and just
as constantly condemned him there. Nothing was
surer in Liot&#8217;s mind than that Bele Trenby was the
child of the Evil One and an inheritor of the kingdom
of wrath; for Bele did the works of his father every
day, and every hour of the day, and Liot told himself
that it was impossible there should be any fellowship
between them. To Bele he said nothing of this spiritual
superiority, and yet it was obvious in his constant
air of disapproval and dissent, in his lofty silence, his
way of not being conscious of Bele&#8217;s presence or of
totally ignoring his remarks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Liot Borson mocks the very heart of me,&#8221; said
Bele to Matilda one day, as he gloomily flung himself
into the big chair she pushed toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What said he, Bele?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word with his tongue, or I had struck him
in the face; but as I was telling about my last cargo
and the run for it, his eyes called me &#8216;<i>Liar! liar!
liar!</i>&#8217; like blow on blow. And when he turned and
walked off the pier some were quiet, and some followed
him; and I could have slain every man&#8217;s son of them,
one on the heels of the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is vain babble, Bele; and I would leave Liot
alone. He has more shapes than one, and he is ill to
anger in any of them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>Bele was not averse to be so counseled. In spite
of his bravado and risky ventures, he was no more a
brave man than a dishonorable or dishonest man ever
is. He knew that if it came to fighting he would be
like a child in Liot&#8217;s big hands, and he had already
seen Liot&#8217;s scornful silence strip his boasting naked.
So he contented himself with the revenge of the coward&#8211;the
shrug and the innuendo, the straight up-and-down
lie, when Liot was absent; the sulky nod or
bantering remark, according to his humor, when Liot
was present.</p>

<p>However, as the weeks went on Liot became accustomed
to the struggle, and more able to take possession
of such aids to mastery of himself as were his
own. First, there was Karen; her loyalty never
wavered. If Liot knew anything surely, it was that
at Christmas she would become his wife. She met
him whenever she could, she sent him constantly
tokens of her love, and she begged him at every
opportunity for her sake to let Bele Trenby alone.
Every day, also, his cousin Paul Borson spoke to
him and praised him for his forbearance; and every
Sabbath the minister asked, &#8220;How goes it, Liot? Is
His grace yet sufficient?&#8221; And at these questions
Liot&#8217;s countenance would glow as he answered gladly,
&#8220;So far He has helped me.&#8221;</p>

<p>From this catechism, and the clasp and look that
gave it living sympathy, Liot always turned homeward
full of such strength that he longed to meet his
enemy on the road, just that he might show him that
&#8220;noble not caring,&#8221; which was gall and wormwood to
Bele&#8217;s touchy self-conceit. It was a great spiritual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
weakness, and one which Liot was not likely to combat;
for prayer was so vital a thing to him that it became
imbued with all his personal characteristics. He
made petition that God would keep him from hurting
Bele Trenby, and yet in his heart he was afraid that
God would hear and grant his prayer. The pagan in
Liot was not dead; and the same fight between the
old man and the new man that made Paul&#8217;s life a constant
warfare found a fresh battle-ground in Liot&#8217;s
soul.</p>

<p>He began his devotions in the spirit of Christ, but
they ended always in a passionate arraignment of
Bele Trenby through the psalms of David. These
wondrously human measures got Liot&#8217;s heart in their
grip; he wept them and prayed them and lived them
until their words blended with all his thoughts and
speech; through them he grew &#8220;familiar&#8221; with God,
as Job and David and Jonah were familiar&#8211;a reverent
familiarity. Liot ventured to tell Him all that he
had to suffer from Bele&#8211;the lies that he could not refute,
the insolences he could not return, his restricted
intercourse with Karen, and the loss of that frank fellowship
with such of his townsmen as had business
reasons for not quarreling with Bele.</p>

<p>So matters went on, and the feeling grew no better,
but worse, between the men. When the devil could
not find a man to irritate Bele and Liot, then he found
Matilda Sabiston always ready to speak for him. She
twitted Bele with his prudences, and if she met Liot
on the street she complimented him on his patience,
and prophesied for Karen a &#8220;lowly mannered husband,
whom she could put under her feet.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>One day in October affairs all round were at their
utmost strain. The summer was over, and Bele was
not likely to make the Shetland coast often till after
March. His talk was of the French and Dutch ports
and their many attractions. And Matilda was cross
at the prospect of losing her favorite&#8217;s society, and
unjustly inclined to blame Bele for his want of success
with her niece.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk if you want to, Bele,&#8221; she said snappishly,
&#8220;of the pretty women in France and Holland. You
are, after all, a great dreamer, and you don&#8217;t dream
true; the fisherman Liot can win where you lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Bele said some words about Liot, and Matilda
laughed. Bele thought the laugh full of scorn; so he
got up and left the house in a passion, and Matilda
immediately turned on Karen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ill luck came with you, girl,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;and I
wish that Christmas was here and that you were out
of my house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No need to wait till Christmas, aunt; I will go
away now and never come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be glad of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul Borson will give me shelter until I move into
my own house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we shall be far apart. I shall not be sorry,
for our chimneys may smoke the better for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is an unkind thing to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is as you take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what people will think of you, aunt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder that, too&#8211;but I care nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that talk will come to little, and that we had
better part.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>&#8220;If you will marry Bele we need not part; then I
will be good to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not marry Bele&#8211;no, not for the round
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, what I have to say is this, and I say it out:
go to the Borsons as soon as you can; there is doubtless
soul-kin between you and them, and I want no
Borson near me, in the body or out of the body.&#8221;</p>

<p>So that afternoon Karen went to live with Paul
Borson, and there was great talk about it. No sooner
had Liot put his foot ashore than he heard the story,
and at once he set it bitterly down against Bele; for
his sake Karen had been driven from her home. There
were those that said it was Bele&#8217;s plan, since she would
not marry him, to separate her from her aunt; he
was at least determined not to lose what money and
property Matilda Sabiston had to leave. These accusations
were not without effect. Liot believed his rival
capable of any meanness. But it was not the question
of money that at this hour angered him; it was
Karen&#8217;s tears; it was Karen&#8217;s sense of shame in being
sent from the home of her only relative, and the certain
knowledge that the story would be in every one&#8217;s
mouth. These things roused in Liot&#8217;s soul hatred
implacable and unmerciful and thirsty for the stream
of life.</p>

<p>Yet he kept himself well in hand, saying little to
Karen but those things usually whispered to beloved
women who are weeping, and at the end of them this
entreaty:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, dear heart of mine! I will see the minister,
and he will call our names in the kirk next Sunday,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
and the next day we shall be married, and then
there will be an end to this trouble. I say nothing of
Matilda Sabiston, but Bele Trenby stirs up bickerings
all day long; he is a low, quarrelsome fellow, a very
son of Satan, walking about the world tempting good
men to sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Karen answered: &#8220;Life is full of waesomeness.
I have always heard that when the heart learns to
love it learns to sorrow; yet for all this, and more too,
I will be your wife, Liot, on the day you wish, for then
if sorrow comes we two together can well bear it.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='footnote_sep' />

<div class='footnote'><a id='Footnote_1'></a><a href='#FNanchor_1'><span class='label'>[1]</span></a>
<p>The last day of Christmas-tide.</p>
</div> <!-- footnote -->

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span><a id='link_2'></a>II<br /><span class='h2fs'>JEALOUSY CRUEL AS THE GRAVE</span></h2>

<p>After this event all Lerwick knew that
Karen Sabiston was to be married to
Liot Borson in less than three weeks.
For the minister was unwilling to
shorten the usual time for the kirk calling,
and Karen, on reflection, had also come to the
conclusion that it was best not to hurry too much.
&#8220;Everything ought to bide its time, Liot,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;and the minister wishes the three askings to be honored;
also, as the days go by, my aunt may think
better and do better than she is now minded to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had my way, Karen&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But just now, Liot, it is my way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yours and the minister&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is like to be good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let it stand at three weeks; but I wish that
the time had not been put off; ill luck comes to a
changed wedding-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you forespeak misfortune, Liot? It is a
bad thing to do. Far better if you went to the house-builder
and told him to hire more help and get the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
roof-tree on; then we need not ask shelter either from
kin or kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a prudent thought, and Liot acknowledged
its wisdom and said he would &#8220;there and then go
about it.&#8221; The day was nearly spent, but the moon
was at its full, and the way across the moor was as
well known to him as the space of his own boat. He
kissed Karen fondly, and promised to return in two
or three hours at the most; and she watched his tall
form swing into the shadows and become part and parcel
of the gray indistinctness which shut in the horizon.</p>

<p>There was really no road to the little hamlet where
the builder lived. The people used the sea road, and
thought it good enough; but the rising moon showed a
foot-path, like a pale, narrow ribbon, winding through
the peat-cuttings and skirting the still, black moss
waters. But in this locality Liot had cut many a
load of peat, and he knew the bottomless streams of
the heath as well as he knew the &#8220;races&#8221; of the coast;
so he strode rapidly forward on his pleasant errand.</p>

<p>The builder, who was also a fisherman, had just
come from the sea; and as he ate his evening meal he
talked with Liot about the new house, and promised
him to get help enough to finish it within a month.
This business occupied about an hour, and as soon as
it was over Liot lit his pipe and took the way homeward.
He had scarcely left the sea-shore when he
saw a man before him, walking very slowly and irresolutely;
and Liot said to himself, &#8220;He steps like one
who is not sure of his way.&#8221; With the thought he
called out, &#8220;<i>Take care!</i>&#8221; and hastened forward; and
the man stood still and waited for him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>In a few minutes Liot also wished to stand still;
for the moon came from behind a cloud and showed
him plainly that the wayfarer was Bele Trenby. The
recognition was mutual, but for once Bele was disposed
to be conciliating. He was afraid to turn back
and equally afraid to go forward; twice already the
moonlight had deceived him, and he had nearly
stepped into the water; so he thought it worth his
while to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, Liot; I am glad you came this road;
it is a bad one&#8211;a devilish bad one! I wish I had taken
a boat. I shall miss the tide, and I was looking to sail
with it. It is an hour since I passed Skegg&#8217;s Point&#8211;a
full hour, for it has been a step at a time. Now you
will let me step after you; I see you know the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with a nervous rapidity, and Liot only
answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Step as you wish to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bele fell a couple of feet behind, but continued to
talk. &#8220;I have been round Skegg&#8217;s Point,&#8221; he said with
a chuckling laugh. &#8220;I wanted to see Auda Brent before
I went away for the winter. Lovely woman!
Brent is a lucky fellow&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brent is my friend,&#8221; answered Liot, angrily. But
Bele did not notice the tone, and he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather have Auda for a friend.&#8221; And
then, in his usual insinuating, boastful way, he praised
the woman&#8217;s beauty and graciousness in words which
had an indefinable offense, and yet one quite capable
of that laughing denial which commonly shielded
Bele&#8217;s impertinence. &#8220;Brent gave me a piece of
Saxony cloth and a gold brooch for her&#8211;Brent is in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
Amsterdam. I have taken the cloth four times;
there were also other gifts&#8211;but I will say nothing
of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are inventing lies, Bele Trenby. Touch your
tongue, and your fingers will come out of your lips
black as the pit. Say to Brent what you have said to
me. You dare not, you infernal coward!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a pretty list of bad words, Liot, and I
won&#8217;t try to change mine with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Liot did not answer. He turned and looked at the
man behind him, and the devil entered into his heart
and whispered, &#8220;<i>There is the venn before you.</i>&#8221; The
words were audible to him; they set his heart on fire
and made his blood rush into his face, and beat on
his ear-drums like thunder. He could scarcely stand.
A fierce joy ran through his veins, and the fiery radiations
of his life colored the air around him; he saw
everything red. The venn, a narrow morass with only
one safe crossing, was before them; in a few moments
they were on its margin. Liot suddenly stopped; the
leather strings of his <i>rivlins</i><a id='FNanchor_2'></a><a href='#Footnote_2' class='fnanchor'><sup>[2]</sup></a> had come unfastened,
and he dropped the stick he carried in order to retie
them. At this point there was a slight elevation on
the morass, and Bele looked at Liot as he put his foot
upon it, asking sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the crossing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Liot fumbled at his shoe-strings and said not a
word; for he knew it was <i>not</i> the crossing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this the crossing, Liot?&#8221; Bele again asked. And
again Liot answered neither yes nor no. Then Bele
flew into a passion and cried out with an oath:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>&#8220;You are a cursed fellow, Liot Borson, and in the
devil&#8217;s own temper; I will stay no longer with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped forward as he spoke, and instantly a
cry, shrill with mortal terror, rang across the moor
from sea to sea. Liot quickly raised himself, but
he had barely time to distinguish the white horror of
his enemy&#8217;s face and the despair of his upthrown
arms. The next moment the moss had swallowed the
man, and the thick, peaty water hardly stirred over
his engulfing.</p>

<p>For a little while Liot fixed his eyes on the spot;
then he lifted his stick and went forward, telling his
soul in triumphant undertones: &#8220;He has gone down
quick into hell; the Lord has brought him down into
the pit of destruction; the bloody and deceitful man
shall not live out half his days; he has gone to his
own place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over and over he reiterated these assurances, stepping
securely himself to the ring of their doom. It
was not until he saw the light in Paul Borson&#8217;s house
that the chill of doubt and the sickness of fear assailed
him. How could he smile into Karen&#8217;s face or clasp
her to his breast again? A candle was glimmering
in the window of a fisherman&#8217;s cottage; he stepped
into its light and looked at his hands. There was no
stain of blood on them, but he was angry at the involuntary
act; he felt it to be an accusation.</p>

<p>Just yet he could not meet Karen. He walked to
the pier, and talked to his conscience as he did so. &#8220;I
never touched the man,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;I said nothing
to lead him wrong. He was full of evil; his last words
were such as slay a woman&#8217;s honor. I did right not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
answer him. A hundred times I have vowed I would
not turn a finger to save his life, and God heard and
knew my vow. He delivered him into my hand; he
let me see the end of the wicked. I am not to blame!
I am not to blame!&#8221; Then said an interior voice,
that he had not silenced, &#8220;Go and tell the sheriff what
has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>Liot turned home at this advice. Why should he
speak now? Bele was dead and buried; let his memory
perish with him. He summoned from every nook
of his being all the strength of the past, the present,
and the future, and with a resolute hand lifted the
latch of the door. Karen threw down her knitting
and ran to meet him; and when he had kissed her
once he felt that the worst was over. Paul asked him
about the house, and talked over his plans and probabilities,
and after an interval he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Bele Trenby&#8217;s ship was ready for sea at the
noon hour; she will be miles away by this time. It
is a good thing, for Mistress Sabiston may now come
to reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will make no odds to us; we shall not be the
better for Bele&#8217;s absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think differently. He is one of the worst of
men, and he makes everything grow in Matilda&#8217;s eyes
as he wishes to. Lerwick can well spare him; a bad
man, as every one knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man that joys the devil. Let us not speak of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he speaks of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His words will not slay me. Kinsman, let us go
to sleep now; I am promised to the fishing with the
early tide.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>But Liot could not sleep. In vain he closed his
eyes; they saw more than he could tell. There were
invisible feet in his room; the air was heavy with
presence, and full of vague, miserable visions; for
&#8220;Wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is very
timorous, and, being pressed with Conscience, always
forecasteth grievous things.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Bele stepped into his grave there had been a
bright moonlight blending with the green, opalish light
of the aurora charging to the zenith; and in this mysterious
mingled glow Liot had seen for a moment
the white, upturned face that the next moment went
down with open eyes into the bottomless water. Now,
though the night had become dark and stormy, he
could not dismiss the sight, and anon the Awful One
who dwelleth in the thick darkness drew near, and for
the first time in his life Liot Borson was afraid. Then
it was that his deep and real religious life came to his
help. He rose, and stood with clasped hands in the
middle of the room, and began to plead his cause,
even as Job did in the night of his terror. In his
strong, simple speech he told everything to God&#8211;told
him the wrongs that had been done him, the provocations
he had endured. His solemnly low implorations
were drenched with agonizing tears, and they
only ceased when the dayspring came and drove the
somber terrors of the night before it.</p>

<p>Then he took his boat and went off to sea, though
the waves were black and the wind whistling loud and
shrill. He wanted the loneliness that only the sea
could give him. He felt that he must &#8220;cry aloud&#8221;
for deliverance from the great strait into which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
had fallen. No man could help him, no human sympathy
come between him and his God. Into such
communions not even the angels enter.</p>

<p>At sundown he came home, his boat loaded with
fish, and his soul quiet as the sea was quiet after the
storm had spent itself. Karen said he &#8220;looked as if he
had seen Death&#8221;; and Paul answered: &#8220;No wonder at
that; a man in an open boat in such weather came
near to him.&#8221; Others spoke of his pallor and his
weariness; but no one saw on his face that mystical
self-signature of submission which comes only through
the pang of soul-travail.</p>

<p>He had scarcely changed his clothing and sat down
to his tea before Paul said: &#8220;A strange thing has happened.
Trenby&#8217;s ship is still in harbor. He cannot
be found; no one has seen him since he left the ship
yesterday. He bade Matilda Sabiston good-by in the
morning, and in the afternoon he told his men to be
ready to lift anchor when the tide turned. The tide
turned, but he came not; and they wondered at it, but
were not anxious; now, however, there is a great fear
about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What fear is there?&#8221; asked Liot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Men know not; but it is uppermost in all minds
that in some way his life-days are ended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, long or short, it is God who numbers
our days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of the matter?&#8221; asked Paul.</p>

<p>&#8220;As you know, kinsman,&#8221; answered Liot, &#8220;I have
ever hated Bele, and that with reason. Often I have
said it were well if he were hurt, and better if he were
dead; but at this time I will say no word, good or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
bad. If the man lives, I have nothing good to say of
him; if he is dead, I have nothing bad to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is wise. Our fathers believed in and feared
the fetches of dead men; they thought them to be not
far away from the living, and able to be either good
friends or bitter enemies to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard that often. No saying is older than
&#8216;Bare is a man&#8217;s back without the kin behind him.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are well clad, Liot, for behind you are
generations of brave and good men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord is at my right hand; I shall not be
moved,&#8221; said Liot, solemnly. &#8220;He is sufficient. I am
as one of the covenanted, for the promise is &#8216;to you
and your children.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Paul nodded gravely. He was a Calvinistic pagan,
learned in the Scriptures, inflexible in faith, yet by no
means forgetful of the potent influences of his heroic
dead. Truly he trusted in the Lord, but he was never
unwilling to remember that Bor and Bor&#8217;s mighty
sons stood at his back. Even though they were in
the &#8220;valley of shadows,&#8221; they were near enough in a
strait to divine his trouble and be ready to help him.</p>

<p>The tenor of this conversation suited both men.
They pursued it in a fitful manner and with long,
thoughtful pauses until the night was far spent; then
they said, &#8220;Good sleep,&#8221; with a look into each other&#8217;s
eyes which held not only promise of present good-will,
but a positive &#8220;looking forward&#8221; neither cared to
speak more definitely of.</p>

<p>The next day there was an organized search for
Bele Trenby through the island hamlets and along
the coast; but the man was not found far or near; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
had disappeared as absolutely as a stone dropped into
mid-ocean. Not until the fourth day was there any
probable clue found; then a fishing-smack came in,
bringing a little rowboat usually tied to Howard
Hallgrim&#8217;s rock. Hallgrim was a very old man and
had not been out of his house for a week, so that it
was only when the boat was found at sea that it was
missed from its place. It was then plain to every one
that Bele had taken the boat for some visit and met
with an accident.</p>

<p>So far the inference was correct. Bele&#8217;s own boat
being shipped ready for the voyage, he took Hallgrim&#8217;s
boat when he went to see Auda Brent; but he either
tied it carelessly or he did not know the power of the
tide at that point, for when he wished to return the
boat was not there. For a few minutes he hesitated;
he was well aware that the foot-path across the moor
was a dangerous one, but he was anxious to leave
Lerwick with that tide, and he risked it.</p>

<p>These facts flashed across Liot&#8217;s mind with the force
of truth, and he never doubted them. All, then, hung
upon Auda Brent&#8217;s reticence; if she admitted that
Bele had called on her that afternoon, some one would
divine the loss of the boat and the subsequent tragedy.
For several wretched days he waited to hear the words
that would point suspicion to him. They were not
spoken. Auda came to Lerwick, as usual, with her
basket of eggs for sale; she talked with Paul Borson
about Bele&#8217;s disappearance; and though Liot watched
her closely, he noticed neither tremor nor hesitation
in her face or voice. He thought, indeed, that she
showed very little feeling of any kind in the matter.
It took him some time to reach the conclusion that
Auda was playing a part&#8211;one she thought best for
her honor and peace.</p>

A LERWICK MAN.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>In the mean time the preparations for his marriage
with Karen Sabiston went rapidly forward. He strove
to keep his mind and heart in tune with them, but it
was often hard work. Sometimes Karen questioned
him concerning his obvious depression; sometimes she
herself caught the infection of his sadness; and there
were little shadows upon their love that she could not
understand. On the day before her marriage she went
to visit her aunt Matilda Sabiston. Matilda did not
deny herself, but afterward Karen wished she had done
so. Almost her first words were of Bele Trenby, for
whom she was mourning with the love of a mother for
an only son.</p>

<p>&#8220;What brings you into my sight?&#8221; she asked the
girl. &#8220;Bele is dead and gone, and you are living! and
Liot Borson knows all about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How dare you say such a thing, aunt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can dare the truth, though the devil listened to
it. As for &#8216;aunt,&#8217; I am no aunt of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am content to be denied by you; and I will see
that Liot makes you pay dearly for the words that you
have said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No fear! he will not dare to challenge them! I
know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have called him a murderer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did the deed, or he has knowledge of it. <i>One</i>
who never yet deceived me tells me so much. Oh, if
I could only bring that <i>one</i> into the court I would
hang Liot higher than his masthead! I wish to die
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
only that I may follow Liot, and give him misery on
misery every one of his life-days. I would also poison
his sleep and make his dreams torture him. If there
is yet one kinsman behind my back, I will force him
to dog Liot into the grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Liot is in the shelter of God&#8217;s hand; he need not
fear what you can do to him. He can prove you liar
far easier than you can prove him murderer. On the
last day of Bele&#8217;s life Liot was at sea all day, and there
were three men with him. He spent the evening with
John Twatt and myself, and then sat until the midnight
with Paul Borson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For all that, he was with Bele Trenby! I know
it! My heart tells me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your heart has often lied to you before this. I
see, however, that our talk had better come to an end
once for all. I will never come here again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be the happier for that. Why did you
come at this time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought that you were in trouble about Bele. I
was sorry for you. I wished to be friends with every
one before I married.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want no pity; I want vengeance; and from here
or <i>there</i> I will compass it. While my head is above
the mold there is no friendship possible between us&#8211;no,
nor after it. Do you think that Bele is out of
your way because he is out of the body? He is now
nearer to you than your hands or feet. And let Liot
Borson look to himself. The old thrall&#8217;s curse was
evil enough, but Bele Trenby will make it measureless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such words are like the rest of your lying; I will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
not fear them, since God is himself, and he shall rule
the life Liot and I will lead together. When a girl
is near her bridal every one but you will give her a
blessing. I think you have no heart; surely you never
loved any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have loved&#8211;<i>yes</i>!&#8221; Then she stood up and cried
passionately: &#8220;Begone! I will speak no more to you&#8211;only
this: ask Liot Borson what was the ending of
Bele Trenby.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was the incarnation of rage and accusation, and
Karen almost fled from her presence. Her first impulse
was to go to Liot with the story of the interview,
but her second was a positive withdrawal of it.
It was the eve of her bridal day, and the house was
already full of strangers. Paul Borson was spending
his money freely for the wedding-feast. In the morning
she was to become Liot&#8217;s wife. How could she
bring contention where there should be only peace
and good-will?</p>

<p>Besides, Liot had told her it was useless to visit
Matilda; he had even urged her not to do so, for all
Lerwick knew how bitterly she was lamenting the loss
of her adopted son Bele; and Liot had said plainly to
Karen: &#8220;As for her good-will, there is more hope of
the dead; let her alone.&#8221; As she remembered these
words a cold fear invaded Karen&#8217;s heart; it turned
her sick even to dismiss it. What if Liot did know
the ending of Bele! She recalled with a reluctant
shiver his altered behavior, his long silences, his
gloomy restlessness, the frequent breath of some icy
separation between them. If Matilda was right in any
measure&#8211;if Liot knew! Merciful God, if Liot had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
had any share in the matter! She could not face him
with such a thought in her heart. She ran down to
the sea-shore, and hid herself in a rocky shelter, and
tried to think the position down to the bottom.</p>

<p>It was all a chaos of miserable suspicion, and at last
she concluded that her fear and doubt came entirely
from Matilda&#8217;s wicked assertions. She would not admit
that they had found in her heart a condition ready
to receive them. She said: &#8220;I will not again think of
the evil words; it is a wrong to Liot. I will not tell
them to him; he would go to Matilda, and there would
be more trouble, and the why and the wherefore spread
abroad; and God knows how the wicked thought
grows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she stooped and bathed her eyes and face in
the cold salt water, and afterward walked slowly back
to Paul Borson&#8217;s. The house was full of company and
merry-making, and she was forced to fall into the mood
expected from her. Women do such things by supreme
efforts beyond the power of men. And Karen&#8217;s smiles
showed nothing of the shadow behind them, even when
Liot questioned her about her visit.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is a bad woman, Liot,&#8221; answered Karen, &#8220;and
she said many temper-trying words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I looked for, Karen. It is her way
about all things to scold and storm her utmost. Does
she trouble you, dear one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not be word-sick for her. There is, as you
said, no love lost between us, and I shall not care a rap
for her anger. Thanks to the Best, we can live without
her.&#8221; And in this great trust she laid her hand in
Liot&#8217;s, and all shadows fled away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>It was then a lovely night, bright with rosy auroras;
but before morning there was a storm. The bridal
march to the kirk had to be given up, and, hooded and
cloaked, the company went to the ceremony as they
best could. There was no note of music to step to; it
was hard enough to breast the gusty, rattling showers,
and the whole landscape was a little tragedy of wind
and rain, of black, tossing seas and black, driving
clouds. Many who were not at the bridal shook their
heads at the storm-drenched wedding-guests, and predicted
an unhappy marriage; and a few ventured to
assert that Matilda Sabiston had been seen going to the
spaewife Asta. &#8220;And what for,&#8221; they asked, &#8220;but to
buy charms for evil weather?&#8221;</p>

<p>All such dark predictions, however, appeared to be
negatived by actual facts. No man in Lerwick was so
happy as Liot Borson. The home he had built Karen
made a marvel of neatness and even beauty; it was
always spotless and tidy, and full of bits of bright color&#8211;gay
patchwork and crockery, and a snow-white
hearth with its glow of fiery peat. Always she was
ready to welcome him home with a loving kiss and
all the material comforts his toil required. <i>And they
loved each other!</i> When that has been said, what remains
unsaid? It covers the whole ground of earthly
happiness.</p>

<p>How the first shadow crossed the threshold of this
happy home neither Liot nor Karen could tell; it came
without observation. It was in the air, and entered as
subtly and as silently. Liot noticed it first. It began
with the return of Brent. When he gave Bele the
piece of cloth and the gold brooch for his wife, he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
on the point of leaving Amsterdam for Java. Fever
and various other things delayed his return, but in the
end he came back to Lerwick and began to talk about
Bele. For Auda, reticent until her husband&#8217;s return,
then told him of Bele&#8217;s visit; and one speculation grew
on the top of another until something like the truth
was in all men&#8217;s minds, even though it was not spoken.
Liot saw the thought forming in eyes that looked at
him; he felt it in little reluctances of his mates, and
heard it, or thought he heard it, in their voices. He
took home with him the unhappy hesitation or misgiving,
and watched to see if it would touch the
consciousness of Karen. The loving wife, just approaching
the perilous happiness of maternity, kept
asking herself, &#8220;What is it? What is it?&#8221; And the
answer was ever the same&#8211;the accusing words that
Matilda Sabiston had said, and the quick, sick terror
of heart they had awakened.</p>

<p>On Christmas day Karen had a son, a child of
extraordinary beauty, that brought his soul into the
world with him. The women said that his eyes instantly
followed the light, and that his birth-cry passed
into a smile. Liot was solemnly and silently happy.
He sat for hours holding his wife&#8217;s hand and watching
the little lad sleeping so sweetly after his first hard
travail; for the birth of this child meant to Liot far
more than any mortal comprehended. He knew himself
to be of religiously royal ancestry, and the covenant
of God to such ran distinctly, &#8220;<i>To you and your
children.</i>&#8221; So, then, if God had refused him children,
he would certainly have believed that for his sin in regard
to Bele Trenby the covenant between God and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
the Borsons was broken. This fair babe was a renewal
of it. He took him in his arms with a prayer of inexpressible
thanksgiving. He kissed the child, and called
him David with the kiss, and said to his soul, &#8220;The
Lord hath accepted my contrition.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some weeks this still and perfect happiness
continued. The days were dark and stormy, and the
nights long; but in Liot&#8217;s home there was the sunlight
of a woman&#8217;s face and the music of a baby&#8217;s voice.
The early spring brought the first anxiety, for it
brought with it no renewal of Karen&#8217;s health and
strength. She had the look of a leaf that is just beginning
to droop upon its stem, and Liot watched her
from day to day with a sick anxiety. He made her go
to sea with him, and laughed with joy when the keen
winds brought back the bright color to her cheeks.
But it was only a momentary flush, bought at far too
great a price of vitality. In a few weeks she could not
pay the price, and the heat of the summer prostrated
her. She had drooped in the spring; in the autumn
she faded away. When Christmas came again there
was no longer any hope left in Liot&#8217;s broken heart; he
knew she was dying. Night and day he was at her
side, there was so much to say to each other; for only
God knew how long they were to be parted, or in what
place of his great universe they should meet again.</p>

<p>At the end of February it had come to this acknowledgment
between them. Sometimes Liot sat with dry
eyes, listening to Karen&#8217;s sweet hopes of their reunion;
sometimes he laid his head upon her pillow and wept
such tears as leave life ever afterward dry at its source.
And the root of this bitterness was Bele Trenby. If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
it had not been for this man Liot could have shared
his wife&#8217;s hopes and said farewell to her with the
thought of heaven in his heart; but the very memory
of Bele sank him below the tide of hope. God was
even then &#8220;entering into judgment with him,&#8221; and
what if he should not be able to endure unto the end,
and so win, though hardly, a painful acceptance? In
every phase and form such thoughts haunted the
wretched man continually. And surely Karen divined
it, for all her sweet efforts were to fill his heart with
a loving &#8220;looking forward&#8221; to their meeting, and a
confident trust in God&#8217;s everlasting mercy.</p>

<p>One stormy night in March she woke from a deep
slumber and called Liot. Her voice had that penetrating
intelligence of the dying which never deceives, and
Liot knew instantly that the hour for parting had come.
He took her hands and murmured in tones of anguish,
&#8220;O Karen, Karen! wife of my soul!&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew him closer, and said with the eagerness of
one in great haste, &#8220;Oh, my dear one, I shall soon be
nearer to God than you. At his feet I will pray. Tell
me&#8211;tell me quick, what shall I ask for you? Liot,
dear one, tell me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask that I may be forgiven <i>all</i> my sins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there one great sin, dear one? Oh, tell me now&#8211;one
about Bele Trenby? Speak quickly, Liot. Did
you see him die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did, but I hurt him not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went into the moss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could have saved him and did not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had spoken in time; there was but a single
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
moment&#8211;I know not what prevented me. O Karen,
I have suffered! I have suffered a thousand deaths!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear one, I have known it. Now we will pray
together&#8211;I in heaven, thou on earth. Fear not, dear,
dear Liot; he spareth all; they are his. The Lord is
the lover of souls.&#8221;</p>

<p>These were her last words. With clasped hands and
wide-open eyes she lay still, watching and listening,
ready to follow when beckoned, and looking with fixed
vision, as if seeing things invisible, into the darkness
she was about to penetrate. Steeped to his lips in
anguish, Liot stood motionless until a dying breath
fluttered through the room; and he knew by his sudden
sense of loss and loneliness that she was gone, and
that for this life he was alone forevermore.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span><a id='link_3'></a>III<br /><span class='h2fs'>A SENTENCE FOR LIFE</span></h2>

<p>All Lerwick had been anticipating the
death of Karen, but when it came there
was a shock. She was so young and so
well loved, besides which her affectionate
heart hid a great spirit; and there
was a general hope that for her husband&#8217;s and child&#8217;s
sake she would hold on to life. For, in spite of all
reasoning, there remains deep in the heart of man a
sense of mastery over his own destiny&#8211;a conviction
that we do not die until we are willing to die. We
&#8220;resign&#8221; our spirits; we &#8220;commit&#8221; them to our Creator;
we &#8220;<i>give up</i> the ghost&#8221;; and it did not seem possible
to the wives and mothers of Lerwick that Karen
would &#8220;give up&#8221; living. Her mortality was so finely
blended with her immortality, it was hard to believe
in such early dissolution. Alas! the finer the nature,
the more readily it is fretted to decay by underlying
wrong or doubt. When Matilda Sabiston drove Karen
down to the sea-shore on the day before her bridal she
really gave her the death-blow.</p>

<p>For Karen needed more than the bread and love of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
mortal life to sustain her. She belonged to that high
order of human beings who require a sure approval of
conscience even for their physical health, and whose
house of life, wanting this fine cement, easily falls to
dissolution. Did she, then, doubt her husband? Did
she believe Matilda&#8217;s accusations to be true? Karen
asked herself these questions very often, and always
answered them with strong assurances of Liot&#8217;s innocence;
but nevertheless they became part of her existence.
No mental decisions, nor even actual words,
could drive them from the citadel they had entered.
Though she never mentioned the subject to Liot,
though she watched herself continually lest any such
doubts should darken her smiles or chill her love, yet
they insensibly impregnated the house in which they
dwelt with her. Liot could not say he felt them here
or there, but they were all-pervading.</p>

<p>Karen withered in their presence, and Liot&#8217;s denser
soul would eventually have become sick with the same
influence. It was, therefore, no calamity that spared
their love such a tragic trial, and if Liot had been a
man of clearer perceptions he would have understood
that it was not in anger, but in mercy to both of them,
that Karen had been removed to paradise. Her last
words, however, had partially opened his spiritual vision.
He saw what poison had defiled the springs of
her life, and he knew instinctively that Matilda Sabiston
was the enemy that had done the deed.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, little wonder that he sent her no
notice of her niece&#8217;s death. And, indeed, Matilda
heard of it first through the bellman calling the funeral
hour through the town. The day was of the stormiest,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
and many remembered how steadily storm and gust
had attended all the great events of Karen&#8217;s short life.
She had been born in the tempest which sent her
father to the bottom of the sea, and she herself, in
coming from Yell to Lerwick, had barely escaped shipwreck.
Her bridal garments had been drenched with
rain, and on the day set for her baby&#8217;s christening
there was one of the worst of snow-storms. Indeed,
many said that it was the wetting she received on that
occasion which had developed the &#8220;wasting&#8221; that
killed her. The same turmoil of the elements marked
her burial day. A cold northeast wind drove through
the wet streets, and the dreary monotony of the outside
world was unspeakable.</p>

<p>But Matilda Sabiston looked through her dim windows
without any sense of the weather&#8217;s depressing
influence&#8211;the storm of anger in her heart was so
much more imperative. She waited impatiently for
the hour appointed for the funeral, and then threw over
her head and shoulders a large hood and cloak of blue
flannel. She did not realize that the wind blew them
backward, that her gray hairs were dripping and disarranged,
and her clothing storm-draggled and unsuitable
for the occasion; her one thought was to reach
Liot&#8217;s house about the time when the funeral guests
were all assembled. She lifted the latch and entered
the crowded room like a bad fate. Every one ceased
whispering and looked at her.</p>

<p>She stepped swiftly to the side of the coffin, which
was resting on two chairs in the middle of the room.
Liot leaned on the one at the head; the minister stood
by the one at the foot, and he was just opening the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
book in his hands. He looked steadily at Matilda, and
there was a warning in the look, which the angry
woman totally disdained. Liot never lifted his eyes;
they were fixed on Karen&#8217;s dead face; but his hands
held mechanically a Bible, open at its proper place.
But though he did not see Matilda, he knew when she
entered; he felt the horror of her approach, and when
she laid her hand on his arm he shook it violently off
and forced himself to look into her evilly gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>She laughed outright. &#8220;So the curse begins,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and this is but the first of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no hour to talk of curses, Mistress Sabiston,&#8221;
said the minister, sternly. &#8220;If you cannot bring
pity and pardon to the dead, then fear to come into
their presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to fear from the dead. It is Liot
Borson who is &#8216;followed,&#8217; not me; I did not murder
Bele Trenby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then,&#8221; answered the minister, &#8220;it is time
there was a stop put to this talk. Speak here, before
the living and the dead, the evil words you have said
in the ears of so many. What have you to say against
Liot Borson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at him!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;He dares to hold in
his hands the Holy Word, and I vow those hands of
his are red with the blood of the man he murdered&#8211;I
mean of Bele Trenby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Liot kept his eyes fixed on her until she ceased speaking;
then he turned them on the minister and said,
&#8220;Speak for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak for thyself once and for all, Liot. Speak
here before God and thy dead wife and thy mates and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
thy townsmen. Did thy hands slay Bele Trenby?
Are they indeed red with his blood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never lifted one finger against Bele Trenby. My
hands are clear and clean from all blood-guiltiness.&#8221;
And he dropped the Word upon Karen&#8217;s breast, and
held up his hands in the sight of heaven and men.</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie!&#8221; screamed Matilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;God is my judge, not you,&#8221; answered Liot.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the word of Liot Borson. Who believes it?&#8221;
asked the minister. &#8220;Let those who do so take the
hands he declares guiltless of blood.&#8221; And the minister
clasped Liot&#8217;s hands as he spoke the words, and
then stepped aside to allow others to follow him. And
there was not one man or woman present who did not
thus openly testify to their belief in Liot&#8217;s innocence.
Matilda mocked them as they did so with output
tongue and scornful laughs; but no one interfered
until the minister said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistress Sabiston, you must now hold your peace
forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not. I will&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is your word against Liot&#8217;s, and your word is
not believed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the angry woman fell into a great rage, and
railed on every one so passionately that for a few
moments she carried all before her. Some of the company
stood up round the coffin, as if to defend the
dead; and the minister looked at Grimm and Twatt,
two big fishermen, and said, &#8220;Mistress Sabiston is beside
herself; take her civilly to her home.&#8221; And they
drew her arms within their own, and so led her storming
out into the storm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>Liot had the better of his enemy, but he felt no sense
of victory. He did not even see the manner of her
noisy exit, for he stood in angry despair, looking down
at the calm face of his dead wife. Then the door shut
out the turmoil, and the solemn voice of the minister
called peace into the disquieted, woeful room. Liot
was insensible to the change. His whole soul was insurgent;
he was ready to accuse heaven and earth of
unutterable cruelty to him. Strong as his physical
nature was, at this hour it was almost impotent. His
feet felt too heavy to move; he saw, and he saw not;
and the words that were spoken were only a chaos of
sounds.</p>

<p>Andrew Vedder and Hal Skager took his right arm
and his left, and led him to his place in the funeral
procession. It was only a small one. Those not
closely connected with the Borsons went to their
homes after the service; for, besides the storm, the
hour was late and the night closing in. It seemed as
if nature showed her antagonism to poor Karen even
to the last scene of her mortal drama; for the tide
flowed late, and a Shetlander can only be buried with
the flowing tide. The failing light, however, was but
a part of the great tragedy of Liot&#8217;s soul; it seemed
the proper environment.</p>

<p>He bared his head as he took his place, and when
urged to put on his hat flung it from him. The storm
beat on Karen&#8217;s coffin; why not on his head also?
People looked at him pitifully as he passed, and an old
woman, as she came out of her cottage to cast the
customary three clods of earth behind the coffin, called
out as she did so, &#8220;The comforts of the Father, Son,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
and Holy Ghost be with you, Liot.&#8221; It was Margaret
Borson, and she was a century old. She tottered into
the storm, and a little child handed her the turf clods,
which she cast with the prayer. It came from kindred
lips, and so entered Liot&#8217;s ears. He lifted his eyes a
moment, looked at the eldrich, shadowy woman trembling
in the gray light, and bowing his head said softly,
&#8220;Thank you, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was not a word spoken at the open grave.
Liot stood in a breathing stupor until all was over, and
then got back somehow to his desolate home. Paul
Borson&#8217;s wife had taken the child away with her, and
other women had tidied the room and left a pot of tea
on the hob and a little bread and meat on the table.
He was alone at last. He slipped the wooden bolt
across the door, and then sat down to think and to
suffer.</p>

<p>But the mercy of God found him out, and he fell
into a deep sleep; and in that sleep he dreamed a
dream, and was a little comforted. &#8220;I have sinned,&#8221;
he said when he awoke; &#8220;but I am His child, and I
cannot slip beyond His mercy. My life shall be atonement,
and I will not fear to fall into His hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, thank God, no grief lasts forever. As the days
and weeks wore away Liot&#8217;s sorrow for his wife grew
more reasonable; then the spring came and the fishing
was to attend to; and anon little David began to interest
his heart and make him plan for the future. He
resolved to save money and send the lad to St. Andrew&#8217;s,
and give him to the service of the Lord. All that he
longed for David should have; all that he had failed
to accomplish David should do. He would give his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
own life freely if by this sacrifice he could make
David&#8217;s life worthy to be an offering at His altar.</p>

<p>The dream, though it never came true, comforted and
strengthened him; it was something to live for. He
was sure that, wherever in God&#8217;s universe Karen now
dwelt, she would be glad of such a destiny for her boy.
He worked cheerfully night and day for his purpose,
and the work in itself rewarded him. The little home
in which he had been so happy and so miserable was
sold, and the money put in the bank for &#8220;David&#8217;s
education.&#8221; All Liot&#8217;s life now turned upon this one
object, and, happily, it was sufficient to restore to him
that hope&#8211;that something to look forward to&#8211;which
is the salt of life.</p>

<p>Matilda gave him no further trouble. She sent him
a bill for Karen&#8217;s board, and he paid it without a word;
and this was the last stone she could throw; besides
which, she found herself compelled by public opinion
to make some atonement for her outrageous behavior,
since in those days it would have been as easy to live
in St. Petersburg and quarrel with the czar as to live
in Shetland and not have the minister&#8217;s approval. So
Mistress Sabiston had a special interview with the
Rev. Magnus Ridlon, and she also sent a sum of money
to the kirk as a &#8220;mortification,&#8221; and eventually was
restored to all sacred privileges, except the great one
of the holy table. This depended inexorably on her
public exoneration of Liot and her cultivation of good-will
toward him. She utterly refused Liot, and preferred
to want the sacred bread and wine rather than
eat and drink them with Liot Borson. And though
Liot declared his willingness to forgive Matilda fully,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
in his heart he was not sorry to be spared the spiritual
obligation.</p>

<p>So the seasons wore away, and summer and winter
brought work and rest, until David was nearly six
years old. By this time the women of Lerwick thought
Liot should look for another wife. &#8220;There is Halla
Odd,&#8221; said Jean Borson; &#8220;she is a widow of thine own
age and she is full-handed. It is proper for thee now
to make a home for thyself and David. When a wife
has been dead four years there has been mourning
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impatient of such talk at first, Liot finally took it
into some consideration; but it always ended in one
way: he cast his eyes to that lonely croft where Karen
slept, and remembered words she had once spoken:</p>

<p>&#8220;In a little while I shall go away, Liot, and people
will say, &#8216;She is in her grave&#8217;; <i>but I shall not be there.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>That was exactly Liot&#8217;s feeling&#8211;Karen was not
there. She had loved God and believed in heaven, and
he was sure that she had gone to heaven. And from
every spot on the open sea or the streeted town or the
solitary moors he had only to look up to the place
where his beloved dwelt. He did, however, as Jean
Borson desired: he thought about Halla Odd; he
watched her ways, and speculated about her money
and her house skill and the likelihood of her making
a good stepmother to David.</p>

<p>Probably, if events had taken their usual course, he
would have married Halla; but at the beginning of the
summer this thing happened: a fine private yacht was
brought into harbor with her sails torn to rags and
her mainmast injured. Coming down from the north,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
she had been followed and caught by a storm, and
was in considerable distress when she was found by
some Lerwick fisher-smacks. Then, as Liot Borson
was the best sailmaker in the town, he was hired to
put the yacht&#8217;s canvas in good condition; and while
doing so the captain of the yacht, who was also her
owner, talked often with him about the different
countries he had visited. He showed him paintings
of famous places and many illustrated volumes of
travel, and so fired Liot&#8217;s heart that his imagination,
like a bird, flew off in all directions.</p>

<p>In a short time the damaged wayfarer, with all her
new sails set, went southward, and people generally
forgot her visit. But Liot was no more the same man
after it. He lived between the leaves of a splendid
book of voyages which had been left with him. Halla
went out of his thoughts and plans, and all his desires
were set to one distinct purpose&#8211;to see the world,
and the whole world. David was the one obstacle.
He did not wish to leave him in Shetland, for his intention
was to bid farewell forever to the island. It
had suddenly become a prison to him; he longed to
escape from it. So, then, David must be taken away
or the boy would draw him back; but the question was,
where should he carry the child?</p>

<p>He thought instantly of his sister, who was married
to a man in comfortable circumstances living at Stornoway,
in the Outer Hebrides, and he resolved to take
David to her. He could now afford to pay well for
his board and schooling, and he was such a firm believer
in the tie of blood-kinship that the possibility
of the child not being kindly treated never entered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
his mind. And as he was thinking over the matter a
man came from Stornoway to the Shetland fishing,
and spoke well of his sister Lizzie and her husband.
He said also that their only child was in the Greenland
whaling-fleet, and that David would be a godsend
of love to their solitary hearts.</p>

<p>This report satisfied Liot, and the rest was easily
managed. Paul Borson urged him to stay until the
summer fishing was over; but Liot was possessed by
the sole idea of getting away, and he would listen to
nothing that interfered with this determination. He
owned half the boat in which he fished, and as it was
just at the beginning of the season he was obliged to
buy the other half at an exorbitant price. But the
usually prudent man would make no delays; he paid
the price asked, and then quickly prepared the boat
for the voyage he contemplated.</p>

<p>One night after David was asleep he carried him
on board of her; and Paul divined his purpose, though
it was unspoken. He walked with him to the boat,
and they smoked their last pipe together in the moonlight
on her deck, and were both very silent. Paul had
told himself that he had a great deal to say to his cousin,
yet when it came to the last hour they found themselves
unable to talk. At midnight both men stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;The tide serves,&#8221; said Liot, softly, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p>And Paul clasped it and answered: &#8220;God be with
thee, Liot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall meet no more in this life, Paul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I tryst thee for the next life; that will be a
good meeting. Fare thee well. God keep thee!&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;THE WATERS OF THE GREAT DEEP.&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>&#8220;And thee also.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we shall be well kept, both of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the last of Shetland for Liot Borson. He
watched his kinsman out of sight, and then lifted his
anchor, and in the silence and moonlight went out to
sea. When the Lerwick people awoke in the morning
Liot was miles and miles away. He was soon forgotten.
It was understood that he would never come
back, and there was no more interest in him than there
is in the dead. Like them, he had had his time of sojourn,
and his place knew him no more.</p>

<p>As for Liot, he was happy. He set his sails, and
covered David more warmly, and then lay down under
the midnight stars. The wind was at his back, and
the lonely land of his birth passed from his eyes as a
dream passes. In the morning the islands were not
to be seen; they were hidden by belts of phantom foam,
wreathed and vexed with spray and spindrift. There
was, fortunately, no wrath in the morning tide, only
a steady, irresistible set to the westward; and this was
just what Liot desired. For many days these favorable
circumstances continued, and Liot and David were
very happy together; but as they neared the vexed seas
which lash Cape Wrath and pour down into the North
Minch, Liot had enough to do to keep his boat afloat.</p>

<p>He was driven against his will and way almost to
the Butt of Lewis; and as his meal and water were
very low, he looked for death in more ways than one.
Then the north wind came, and he hoped to reach the
broad Bay of Stornoway with it; but it was soon so
strong and savage that nothing could be done but
make all snug as possible for the gale and then run
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
before it. It proved to be worse than Liot anticipated,
and, hungry and thirsty and utterly worn out, the
helpless boat and her two dying occupants were picked
up by some Celtic coasters from Uig, and taken to the
little hamlet to which they were going.</p>

<p>There Liot stayed all summer, fishing with the men
of the place; but he was not happy, for, though they
were Calvinists as to faith, they were very different
from the fair, generous, romantic men of his own
islands. For the fishers of Uig were heavy-faced Celts,
with the impatient look of men selfish and greedy of
gain. They made Liot pay well for such privileges as
they gave him; and he looked forward to the close of
the fishing season, for then he was determined to go
to Stornoway and get David a more comfortable and
civilized home, after which he would sell his boat and
nets. And then? Then he would take the first passage
he could get to Glasgow, for at Glasgow there
were ships bound for every port in the world.</p>

<p>It was on the 5th of September that he again set
sail for Stornoway, and on the 11th he was once more
brought back to Uig. A great storm had stripped
him of everything he possessed but his disabled boat.
David was in a helpless, senseless condition, and Liot
had a broken arm, and fainted from suffering and
exhaustion while he was being carried on shore. In
some way he lost his purse, and it contained all his
money. He looked at the sea and he looked at the
men, and he knew not which had it. So there was
nothing possible for another winter but poverty and
hard toil, and perchance a little hope, now and then,
of a better voyage in the spring.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>With endless labor and patience he prepared for
this third attempt, and one lovely day in early June
set sail for the Butt of Lewis. He had good weather
and fair winds for two days; then the norther came
and drove him round Vatternish, and into the dangerous
whirlpools and vexed waterways of that locality.
His boat began to leak, and he was forced to abandon
her, and for thirty hours to thole the blustering winds
and waves that tossed the little cockle-shell, in which
they took a last refuge, like a straw upon the billows.
Again the men of Uig brought them to shore; and
this time they were sulky, and expressed no sympathy
for Liot&#8217;s disappointment, loss, and suffering. They
had become superstitious about him, and they speculated
and wondered at the ill luck that always drove
him back to Skye. Roy Hunish, a very old man, spoke
for the rest when he said, &#8220;It seems to me, Liot Borson,
that the Lord has not sent you to Stornoway; he
is against the journey.&#8221; And Liot answered sadly:
&#8220;He is against all I desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had been warmed and fed and rested in
one of the nearest cottages, Liot took David in his
arms and went back to his old hut. He put the sleeping
child in the bunk, and then sat down on the cold,
dark hearthstone. What Hunish expressed so plainly
was the underlying thought in his own heart. He
could not escape from a conclusion so tragically manifested.
In sorrow too great for tears, he compelled
himself to resign all his hopes and dreams&#8211;a renunciation
as bitter as wormwood, but not as cruelly bitter
as the one it included; for his rejection was also the
rejection of his son. God had not forgiven him, nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
had he accepted David&#8217;s dedication to his service, for
he had stripped him of all means to accomplish it.
He might have permitted him to reach Stornoway and
leave the boy among his kindred; he had chosen rather
to include David in the sin of his father. This was
the thought that wounded his heart like a sword. He
went to the sleeping boy and kissed his face, weeping
most of all for the sorrow he had brought on the innocent
one.</p>

<p>If this earth be a penal world, Liot that night went
down to one of its lowest hells. Sorrow of many kinds
brutally assailed him. He hid nothing from his consciousness.
He compelled himself to see over again
the drowning of Bele&#8211;that irreparable wrong which
had ruined all his happiness; he compelled himself to
stand once more by Karen&#8217;s coffin, and listen to his
own voice calling God to witness his innocence; he
compelled himself to admit that he had thought God
had forgotten his sin of seven years ago. And when
these things had been thought out to the end, his heart
was so full that he quite unconsciously gave utterance
to his thoughts in audible speech. The tones of his
voice in the darkness were like those of a man praying,
and the hopeless words filled the sorrowful room
with a sense of suffering:</p>

<p>&#8220;So, then, it is for a life-sentence that I am sent
here. There is to be no pardon till I have dreed out
the years appointed me in the gust and poverty of this
dreadful place, among its hard, unfriendly men. My
God! I am but thirty-three years old. How long wilt
thou be angry with me? And the little lad! Pass
me by, but oh, be merciful to him!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>A great silence followed this imploration. The man
was waiting. For hours he sat motionless; but just
before dawn he must have heard a word of strength
or comfort, for he rose to his feet and bowed his head.
He was weeping bitterly, and his voice was like a sob;
but from that hut on the wild Skye coast there arose
with a heartbroken cry the sublimest of mortal prayers&#8211;&#8220;<i>Thy
will be done.</i>&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span><a id='link_4'></a>IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE DOOR WIDE OPEN</span></h2>

<p>Resignation is not always contentment,
and though Liot accepted God&#8217;s
will in place of his own will, he took it
rather with a dour patience than with a
cheerful satisfaction. Yet in a certain
way life gets made independent of our efforts. A
higher power than our own brings events about, finds
a way across the hills of difficulty, smooths out the
rough places, and makes straight what our folly has
made crooked. When it became certain that Liot
would make his life-home near Uig the men on that
coast began to treat him with more friendliness, and
the women pitied and cared a little for his motherless
boy. And by and by there came a new minister, who
found in Liot a man after his own heart. The two
men became familiars, and the friendship made life
more supportable to both.</p>

<p>It was a hard existence, however, for the child.
Liot loved his son, but he was not a demonstrative
father, and he thought more of doing his duty to David
than of showing him affection or providing him with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
pleasure. For when all hopes of making him a minister
were over David lost something in Liot&#8217;s estimation.
He was, then, just a common lad, in whose
heart, as a matter of course, folly and disobedience
were bound up. It was his place to exorcise everything
like joy, and with the phantoms of a gloomy
creed to darken and terrify his childhood.</p>

<p>Before David had shed his baby teeth, hell and the
devil were tremendous realities to him. An immaculate,
pitiless God, who delighted in taking vengeance
on his enemies, haunted all his boyhood&#8217;s dreams; and
the &#8220;scheme of salvation,&#8221; by which perchance this
implacable Deity might be conciliated, was the beginning
and the end of his education. With an amazing
distinctness in question and answer, this &#8220;scheme&#8221;
was laid before him, and by the word and the rod of
admonition he was made familiar with the letter of
its awful law.</p>

<p>Here, then, was a child whom a sad destiny had led
far away from happiness. His nature was singularly
affectionate, yet he had no memory of a mother&#8217;s kiss,
or, indeed, of any tender human kindness. No one
petted or loved him; no one heeded his childish sorrows
and sufferings. He had toothaches and earaches,
about which he felt it useless to speak. He went into
the boats with his father as soon as he could bait a
line, and was forced to endure all that men endured
from salt-water boils, chilblains, frost-bites, and the
lashing of spray-laden winds. Cold and hunger, heat
and thirst, and the frequent intolerable sleepiness of
overtaxed strength made up the sad drama of his
childhood; and he played his part in it with a patient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
submission that sometimes won from his father astonishment
and a few words of praise or admiration.</p>

<p>Such words made glorious epochs in the boy&#8217;s life;
he could remember every one of them. Once, when
Liot could get no one to launch a boat and go with
him to the help of four men drowning before their
eyes, the ten-year-old lad came radiantly forward and
said, &#8220;Take me, father; I will go with you.&#8221; And the
two went on the desperate errand together, and brought
back safely the men ready to perish. Then, when all
was well over and the child stood trembling with exhaustion,
Liot drew him close to his side, and pushed
his wet hair from his brow, and said with proud tenderness,
&#8220;You are a good, brave boy. God bless you,
David!&#8221; And the happy upward look of the child
had his mother&#8217;s smile in it, and before Liot knew
what he was doing he had stooped and kissed him.
The event was a wonderful one, and it made a tie between
the father and the son that it was beyond the
power of time to loosen.</p>

<p>Liot&#8217;s own boyhood had been filled with the dreams
and stories of the elder world. He had been conscious
all his life of this influence streaming up from the
centuries behind him, and coloring, and even moving,
his present existence. The fierce hatred he felt for
Bele Trenby came from unchristened ancestors, and
the dumb murder, which had darkened his life and
sent him to Uig, from the same source. He told David
none of these stirring sagas. He was resolved that
the knowledge of the thrall&#8217;s curse should not call sorrow
to him. He never named the heroic Gisli in his
hearing. And once, when he found an old fisherman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
reciting &#8220;Ossian&#8221; to David, he fell into such anger as
terrified every one. Indeed, he said words at that
hour which would have made much trouble and ill-will
if the minister had not justified them and called
Liot&#8217;s anger a &#8220;righteous one.&#8221;</p>

<p>And in those days there was absolutely no literature
for the people. Books were dear and scarce; ten years
might pass without a new one drifting into a hamlet;
and newspapers were few and for the rich alone.
David, then, had but one book&#8211;the Holy Scriptures.
He read them, and read them again, and found everything
in them. Fortunately, the wonderful wisdom
and stories of the Apocrypha had not then been discarded;
the book had its place between the Old and
the New Testament. And David was wise with Solomon,
and saw beautiful visions with Esdras, and lived
and glowed and fought with the heroic Maccabees.</p>

<p>And we who have far more books than we can read
can hardly understand how David loved the Bible. It
was his poetry, his philosophy, his history; it was,
above all, the speech of God to man. Through it he
breathed the air of the old, old East, and grew up
under the shadows of Judea&#8217;s palms and olives; so
that the rainy gloom of the coast of Skye was but
an accident of his existence. Abraham and Joseph,
Moses and Joshua, were far more real personages to
David Borson than the Duke of Wellington or Napoleon
and his twelve marshals. Through the stormy
days when it was impossible to go to sea, and in the
long winter nights, when he stretched himself before
the red peats with a little oil-cruse, he and the Bible
were friends and companions. It kept him in direct
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
relation with God and heaven; it fed him on faith; it
made him subject to duty; it gave him a character at
once courageous and gentle, calm and ideal&#8211;such a
character as is very rare in our days, and which, where
it does exist, will <i>not</i> be transmitted.</p>

<p>So that, with all his hard work and many deprivations,
David had his happy hours. And the years
went by, and he grew up to a fair and stately manhood,
not rebelling against his fate, but taking it as a
part of the inscrutable mystery of life and death constantly
before his eyes. Others around him suffered
in like manner, and at the end one thing happened to
all. No; it was not the tyranny of nature nor of his
material life that troubled David as he approached
manhood; it was the spiritual tyranny under which
he lived and prayed which darkened his days and filled
his nights with thoughts which he dared not follow to
their proper conclusion and was equally afraid to dismiss.</p>

<p>This was his dilemma. He had been taught by a
father whom he trusted implicitly that life was only
a short and precarious opportunity for working out
his salvation with fear and trembling; peradventure
he might be counted among the remnant whom God
would elect to save from eternal misery. And in a
measure the constant east winds and cloudy heavens,
the cold and stormy seas, and the gloom and poverty
of all his surroundings were so many confirmations
of this unhappy conviction. Yet it was very hard for
him to believe that the God of the Bible, &#8220;like a father
pitying his children,&#8221; was the God of his Shorter and
Longer Catechisms. As his twentieth year approached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
these doubts and questions would not be put away,
and yet he dared not speak of them either to the minister
or to his father.</p>

<p>Then, one night, as he was watching his lines and
hooks, something happened which broke the adamantine
seal upon his soul. He was quite alone in his
boat, and she was drifting slowly under the full moon;
there was not a sound upon the ocean but the wash of
the water against her sides. He was sitting motionless,
thinking of the sadness and weariness of life, and
wishing that God would love him, though ever so little,
and, above all, that he would give him some word
or sign of his care for him. His hands were clasped
upon his knees, his eyes fixed on the far horizon; between
him and the God whom he so ignorantly feared
and desired there was apparently infinite space and
infinite silence.</p>

<p>All at once some one seemed to come into the boat
beside him. An ineffable peace and tenderness, a
sweetness not to be described, encompassed the lonely
youth. He was sensible of a glory he could not see;
he was comforted by words that were inaudible to his
natural ears. During this transitory experience he
scarcely breathed, but as it slowly passed away he rose
reverently to his feet. &#8220;An angel has been with me,&#8221;
he thought.</p>

<p>After this event the whole fabric of his creed vanished
at times before the inexplicable revelation. Yet
the terrible power of early impressions is not easily
eradicated, even by the supernatural; and whenever
he reasoned about the circumstance he came to the
conclusion that it might have been a snare and a delusion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
of the Evil One. For why should an angel be
sent with a word to him? or why should he dare to
hope that his longing after God&#8217;s love had touched
the heart of the Eternal? Yet, though the glory was
dissolved by the doubting, nothing could quite rob
him of his blessing; in the midst of the sternest realities
of his rough daily toil he found himself musing
on those wonderful days when angels went and came
among men as they threshed their wheat or worked at
their handicrafts, when prayer was visibly answered
and the fire dropped from heaven on the accepted
sacrifice.</p>

<p>He thought the more on this subject because his
father was visibly dying from some internal disease,
which was dissolving with rapid, inexorable suffering
the house of clay in which the soul of Liot Borson
dwelt. Liot was aware of it, and had borne with
silent courage the enemy&#8217;s advances toward the citadel
of life. Very reluctantly he had given up his duties
one by one, until the day came when nothing remained
for him to do but to wait and to suffer; then he spoke
plainly to David. It happened to be the lad&#8217;s twenty-sixth
birthday, and Liot had his own memories of the
first one. Almost inadvertently the name of Karen
passed his lips, and then he talked long of her goodness,
her love, and her beauty; and David listened
with an interest that tempted more confidence than
Liot had ever thought to give.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had such a wife as Karen Sabiston was to
me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;then, David, you would be happy even
in this place. But you will not stay here. When I
am gone away to the land very far off, then you will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
go back to Shetland&#8211;to your own land and your own
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do as you wish, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will marry; that is to be looked for. I have
seen that girl of Talisker&#8217;s watching you, and luring
you with her sly smiles and glances. Give her no
notice. I like not these Celtic women, with their
round black eyes and their red color and black hair.
In Shetland you will see women that you may safely
love&#8211;good and beautiful girls of your own race; there
must be no strange women among the Borsons. Your
Bible tells you what sorrow comes from marrying
daughters of Heth and their like. Go to Shetland for
your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find friends and kindred there&#8211;my good
cousin Paul, and his sons and daughters, and your
mother&#8217;s family in Yell, and Matilda Sabiston. I
would say something of her, but she is doubtless in
the grave by this time, and gone to the mercy of the
Merciful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was she of our kindred, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of your mother&#8217;s kin. They were ill friends here,
but yonder all may&#8211;all <i>will</i> be different.&#8221;</p>

<p>During this conversation Liot made his son understand
that the messenger of release might come at any
hour; but in the morning he felt so free from pain
that David thought he could safely go to the early
fishing. When he reached the pier, however, the boat
had sailed without him, and he walked into Uig and
told the minister how near the end it was. And the
minister answered:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>&#8220;We have had our farewell, David. We shall meet
no more till we meet in the city of God.&#8221; He spoke
with a subdued enthusiasm, and his grave face was
luminous with an interior transfiguration. Suddenly
the sun came from behind a cloud, and the flying
shower was crowned with a glorious rainbow. He
drew David to the window, and said in a rapture of
adoration:</p>

<p>&#8220;The token of His covenant! It compasseth the
heavens about with a glorious circle, and <i>the hands of
the Most High have bended it</i>. Could any words be
more vitally realistic, David? Tell your father what
you have seen&#8211;the token of His covenant! The
token of His covenant!&#8221;</p>

<p>And David went away, awed and silent; for there
was in the minister&#8217;s eyes that singular brilliance
which presages a vision of things invisible. They
looked straight into the sunshine. Did they see beyond
it to where the &#8220;innumerable company of angels&#8221;
were singing, &#8220;Holy, holy, holy&#8221;?</p>

<p>Indeed, he was so much impressed that he took the
longest way home. He wanted to think over what
his father and the minister had said, and he wanted
that solitude of nature which had so often been to him
the voice of God. The road itself was only a foot-path
across a melancholy moor, covered with heather
and boulders, and encompassed by cyclopean wrecks
of mountains, the vapory outlines of which suggested
nothing but endless ruin. Although the season was
midsummer, there had been sharp, surly whiffs of
rain all day long, and the dreary levels were full of
little lochs of black moss water. So David kept to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
the seaward side, where the land was higher, and where
he could see the roll of a spent gale swinging round
Vatternish toward the red, rent bastions of Skye, and
hear its thunder amid the purple caves of the basalt
and the whitened tiers of the oölite, silencing all meaner
sounds.</p>

<p>After a trailing, thoughtful walk of a mile, he came
to a spot where a circle of druidical monoliths stood
huge and pale in the misty air. He went straight into
the haunted place with the manner of one familiar with
it, cast his nets on the low central stone which had once
been the sacrificial altar of the dead creed, and then
leaned wearily against one of the sheltering pillars.</p>

<p>His person was at this time remarkably handsome
and in wonderful harmony with its surroundings.
He was large and strong&#8211;a man not made for the
narrow doorways of the town, but for the wide, stormy
spaces of the unstreeted ocean. The sea was in his
eyes, which were blue and outlooking; his broad breast
was bared to the wind and rain; his legs were planted
apart, as if he was hauling up an anchor or standing
on a reeling deck. An air of somber gravity, a face
sad and mystical, distinguished his solitary figure.
He was the unconscious incarnation of the lonely land
and the stormy sea.</p>

<p>Leaning against the pagan pillar, he revolved in his
mind those great questions that survive every change
of race and dynasty: Whence come we? Where go
we? How can a man be justified with God? Though
the rain smote him east and west, he was in the sunshine
of the Holy Land; he was drawing nets with
Simon Peter on the Sea of Galilee; he was listening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
to Him who spake as never man spake. Suddenly the
sharp whistle of a passing steamer roused him. He
turned his eyes seaward, and saw the <i>Polly Ann</i> hastening
to the railway port with her load of fish for the
Glasgow market. The sight set him again in the
nineteenth century. Then he felt the rain, and he
drew his bonnet over his brows, and lifted his nets,
and began to walk toward the little black hut on the
horizon. It was of large stones roughly mortared
together, and it had a low chimney, and a door fastened
with a leather strap; but the small window wanted
the screen of white muslin usual in Highland cots,
and was dim with dust and cobwebs.</p>

<p>It was David&#8217;s home, and he knew his father waited
there for his coming; so he hastened his steps; but
the radiant, dreamy look which had made him handsome
was gone, and he approached the door with the
air of a man who is weary of to-day and without hope
for the morrow. At the threshold he threw off this
aspect, and entered with a smile. His father, sitting
wearily in a wooden arm-chair, turned his face to
meet him. It was the face of a man walking with
death. Human agony grimly borne without complaint
furrowed it; gray as ashes were the cheeks, and
the eyes alone retained the &#8220;spark of heavenly flame&#8221;
which we call life.</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been a change, David,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and it
is well you are come; for I know I must soon be going,
and there is this and that to say&#8211;as there always is
at the parting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that you are worse, father. Let me go for
the doctor now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>&#8220;I will have no man meddle with the hour of my
death; no one shall either hurry or delay it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The doctor might give you some ease from your
sore pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will bear His will to the uttermost. But come
near to me, David; I have some last words to say, and
there is One at my side hasting me forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me your wish now, father. I will do all that
you desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you have put me in my grave, go to Shetland
for me. I thought to do my own errand&#8211;to get
there just in time to do it, and die; but it is hard
counting with Death&#8211;he comes sooner than you expect.
David, I have brought you up in the way of life.
Think no wrong of me when I am gone away forever.
Indeed, you&#8217;ll not dare to,&#8221; he said with a sudden
flash of natural pride in himself; &#8220;for though I may
have had a sore downfall, I could not get away from
His love and favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None living shall say wrong of you in my hearing,
father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, David, there are those of the unregenerate
who would make much of my little slip. I might die,
lad, and say nothing to any man about it. Put a few
peats on the fire; death is cold, and my feet are in the
grave already; so I may tell the truth now, for at this
hour no man can make me afraid. And there is no
sin, I hope, in letting Matilda Sabiston know, if she is
still alive, that I owe Bele Trenby nothing for the
wrong he did me. St. Paul left the Almighty to pay
the ill-will he owed Alexander the coppersmith; but I
could not ask that much favor, being only Liot Borson;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
and no doubt the Lord suffered me to pay my own
debt&#8211;time and place being put so unexpected into my
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he was awfully silent. The mortal agony was
dealing its last sharp blows, and every instinct impelled
him to cry out against the torment. But Liot
Borson had put his mortality beneath his feet; nothing
could have forced a cry from him. His face
changed as a green leaf might change if a hot iron was
passed over it; but he sat grasping the rude arms of
his wooden chair, disdaining the torture while it lasted,
and smiling triumphantly as it partly passed away.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few more such pangs and the fight will be over,
David. So I will swither and scruple no longer; I
will tell the whole truth about the drowning of Bele
Trenby. Bele and I were never friends; but I hated
him when he began to meddle between me and Karen
Sabiston. He had no shadow of right to do so, for I
had set my heart on her and she had given me her
promise; and I said then, and I say it now with death
at my elbow, that he had no right to step between me
and Karen. Yet he tried to do that thing, and if it
had not been for the minister I had stabbed him to his
false heart. But the minister bade me do no wrong,
because I was of the household of faith, and a born
and baptized child of God, having come&#8211;mind this,
David&#8211;of generations of his saints. He said if Bele
had done me wrong, wrong would come to Bele, and
I would live to see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay&#8217;,&#8221; quoted David,
in a low voice. But Liot answered sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Lord sends by whom he will send. And it so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
happened that one night, as Bele and I were walking
together, I knew the hour had come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You took not the matter in your own hands surely,
father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was none there but me. I laid no finger on
him; he fell into his own snare. I had said a thousand
times&#8211;and the Lord had heard me say it&#8211;that if one
word of mine would save Bele Trenby from death, I
would not say that one word. Could I break my oath
for a child of the Evil One? Had Bele been of the
elect I would have borne that in mind; but Bele came
of bad stock; pirates and smugglers were his forebears,
and the women not to name with the God-fearing&#8211;light
and vain women. So I hated Bele, and I
had a right to hate him; and one night, as I walked
from Quarf to Lerwick, Bele came to my side and said,
&#8216;Good evening, Liot.&#8217; And I said, &#8216;It is dark,&#8217; and
spoke no more. And by and by we came to a stream
swollen with rain and snow-water, and Bele said, &#8216;Here
is the crossing.&#8217; And I answered him not, for I knew
it was <i>not</i> the crossing. So as I delayed a little&#8211;for
my shoe-string was loose&#8211;Bele said again, &#8216;Here is
the crossing.&#8217; And I told him neither yes nor no.
And he said to me, &#8216;It seemeth, Liot, thou art in a
devil&#8217;s temper, and I will stay no longer with thee.&#8217;
And with the ill words on his lips he strode into the
stream, and then overhead into the moss he went, and
so to his own place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, I am feared for a thing like that. There
would be sin in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I lifted no finger against him; my lips lied not.
It was the working out of his own sin that slew him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>&#8220;I would have warned him&#8211;yes, I would. Let me
go for the minister; he will not be feared to say, &#8216;Liot,
you did wrong,&#8217; if so he thinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had my plea out with my Maker. If I did
sin, I have paid the price of the sin. Your mother
was given to me, and in two years the Lord took her
away. I thought to fill my eyes with a sight of the
whole world, and I was sent to this desolate place for
a life-sentence, to bide its storm and gloom and gust
and poverty, and in this bit cabin to dree a long, fierce
wrestle with Death, knowing all the time he would
get the mastery over me in the end.&#8221; Then, suddenly
pausing, his gray face glowed with passionate rapture,
and lifting up his right hand he cried out: &#8220;No, no,
David; <i>I</i> am the conqueror! There are two ways of
dying, my lad&#8211;victory and defeat. Thank God, I have
the victory through Jesus Christ, my Lord and Saviour!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is the propitiation for all sin, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sin!&#8221; cried the dying man, &#8220;sin! I have nothing
to do with sin. &#8216;Who shall lay anything to the charge
of God&#8217;s elect?&#8217; for, &#8216;Whosoever is born of God doth
not commit sin&#8211;he cannot sin, for he is born of God.&#8217;
I did indeed make a sore stumble; so also did David,
and natheless he was a man after God&#8217;s own heart.
What has man to do with my fault? <i>He</i> has entered
into judgment with me, and I have gladly borne the
hand of the smiter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gladly, father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, David, gladly. For had I not been <i>his</i> son,
he would have &#8216;let me alone,&#8217; as he does those joined
to their idols; but because he loved me he chastised
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
me; and I have found that his rod as well as his staff
can comfort in affliction. Some of his bairns deserve
and get the rod of iron. Be good, David, and he
will stretch out to you only his golden scepter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And also you have the Intercessor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I had not I would plead my own cause, as Job
did. I would rise up and answer him like a man, for
he is a just God. Mercy may have times and seasons,
but justice is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever.
&#8216;Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you say that, father, if justice sent you to
the place of torment?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, would I! &#8216;Though he slay me, yet will I
trust in him.&#8217; But I am not fearing the place of torment,
David. And as for this world, it is at my feet
like a cast-off shoe, and all its gold and gear is as the
wrack of the sea. But you will find a few sovereigns
in my chest, and a letter for your cousin Paul Borson;
and the ship and the house you may do your
will with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is your will in all things that I care to do, father.
And now, if you would but let me away for the minister,
maybe you could say a word to him you are not
caring to say to me&#8211;a word of sorrow or remorse&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remorse! remorse! No, no, David! Remorse
is for feeble souls; remorse is the virtue of hell; remorse
would sin again if it could. I have repented,
David, and repentance ends all. See to your Larger
Catechism, David&#8211;Question 76.&#8221;</p>

<p>Throughout this conversation speech had been becoming
more and more painful to him. The last words
were uttered in gasps of unconquerable agony, and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>
mortal spasm gave a terrible emphasis to this spiritual
conviction. When it had passed he whispered faintly,
&#8220;The pains of hell get hold on me&#8211;on my body,
David; they cannot touch my soul. Lay me down
now&#8211;at His feet&#8211;I can sit in my chair no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>So David laid him in his bunk. &#8220;Shall I say <i>the
words</i> now&#8211;the words you marked, father?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay; the hour has come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David knelt down and put his young, fresh
face very close to the face of the dying man, and said
solemnly and clearly in his very ear the chosen words
of trust:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;When the waves of death compassed me;</p>

<p>&#8220;When the sorrows of hell compassed me about, and the
snares of death prevented me,</p>

<p>&#8220;In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God:
and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did
enter into his ears.&#8221;</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<hr class='tb' />

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell
gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech
thee, deliver my soul....</p>

<p>&#8220;Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt
bountifully with thee.</p>

<p>&#8220;For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
tears, and my feet from falling....</p>

<p>&#8220;Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.&#8221;</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>Here David ceased. It was evident that the mighty
words were no longer necessary. A smile, such as is
never seen on mortal face until the light of eternity
falls upon it, illumined the gaunt, stern features, and
the outlooking eyes flashed a moment in its radiance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
A solemn calm, a certain pomp of conscious grandeur
in his victory over death and the grave, encompassed
the dying man, and gave to the prone figure a majestic
significance. As far as this world was concerned, Liot
Borson was a dead man. For two days he lingered on
life&#8217;s outermost shoal, but at sunrise the third morning
he went silently away. It was full tide; the waves
broke softly on the shingle, and the sea-birds on the
lonely rocks were crying for their meat from God.
Suddenly the sunshine filled the cabin, and David was
aware of something more than the morning breeze
coming through the wide-open door. A sense of lofty
<i>presence</i> filled the place. &#8220;It is the flitting,&#8221; he said
with a great awe; and he stood up with bowed head
until a feeling of indescribable loneliness testified that
the soul which had hitherto dwelt with him was gone
away forever.</p>

<p>He went then to the body. Death had given it dignity
and grandeur. It was evident that in Liot&#8217;s case
the great change had meant victory and not defeat.
Almost for the first time in his life David kissed his
father. Then he went into Uig and told the minister,
and said simply to his mates, &#8220;My father is dead.&#8221;
And they answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a happy change for him, David. Is it to-morrow
afternoon you would like us to come?&#8221;</p>

<p>And David said: &#8220;Yes; at three o&#8217;clock the minister
will be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He declined all companionship; he could wake alone
with the dead. For the most part he sat on the door-step
and watched the rising and setting of the constellations,
or walked to and fro before the open door,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
ever awfully aware of that outstretched form, the house
of clay in which his father and companion had dwelt
so many years at his side. Sometimes he slept a little
with his head against the post of the door, and then
the sudden waking in the starlight made him tremble.</p>

<p>He had thought this night would be a session of
solemnity never to be forgotten; but he found himself
dozing and his thoughts drifting, and it was only by
an effort that he could compel anything like the attitude
he desired. For we cannot kindle when we will
the sacred fire of the soul. And David was disappointed
in his spiritual experience, and shocked at what he
called his coldness and indifference, which, after all,
were not coldness and indifference, but the apathy of
exhausted feeling and physical weariness.</p>

<p>The next afternoon there was a quiet gathering in
the cabin that had been Liot&#8217;s, and a little prayer and
admonition; then, in the beauteous stillness of the summer
day, the fishers made a bier of their crossed oars,
and David laid his father upon it. There was no coffin;
the long, majestic figure of humanity was only folded
close in a winding-sheet and his own blue blanket.
So, by the sea-shore, as the tide murmured and the sun
glinted brightly through swirling banks of gray clouds,
they carried him to his long home. No one spoke
as he entered it. The minister dropped his kerchief
upon the upturned face, and David cast the first earth.
Then the dead man&#8217;s friends, each taking the spade
in his turn, filled in the empty place, and laid over it
the sod, and went silently away in twos and threes,
each to his own home.</p>

<p>When all had disappeared, David followed. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
now an irresistible impulse to escape from his old surroundings.
He did not feel as if he cared to see again
any one who had been a part of his past. He went
back to the cabin, ate some bread and fish, and then
with a little reluctance opened his father&#8217;s chest. There
was small wealth in it&#8211;only some letters, and Liot&#8217;s
kirk clothes, and a leather purse containing sixteen
sovereigns. David saw at a glance that the letters
were written by his mother. He wondered a moment
if his father had yet found her again, and then he
kissed the bits of faded script and laid them upon the
glowing peats. The money he put in his pocket, and
the chest and clothing he resolved to take to Shetland
with him. As for the cabin, he decided to give it to
Bella Campbell. &#8220;She was sore put to it last winter
to shelter her five fatherless bairns; and if my father
liked any one more than others, it was Angus Campbell,&#8221;
he thought.</p>

<p>Then he went out and looked at the boat. &#8220;It is
small,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it will carry me to Shetland. I
can keep in the shadows of the shore. And though it
is a far sail round Cape Wrath and Dunnet Head, it is
summer weather, and I&#8217;ll win my way if it so pleases
God.&#8221;</p>

<p>And thus it happened that on the first day of August
this lonely wayfarer on cheerless seas caught sight of
the gray cliffs of the Shetlands, lying like dusky spots
in the sapphire and crimson splendors of the setting
sun.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span><a id='link_5'></a>V<br /><span class='h2fs'>A NEW LIFE</span></h2>

<p>Between David and the misty Hebrides
there was now many a league of the separating,
changeful, dangerous, tragic sea,
but the journey over this great waterway
had been a singularly fortunate
one. David, indeed, had frequently likened himself to
the young Tobias on a similar errand; for his father
had particularly pointed out this history, and had
read aloud to him with an emphasis not to be forgotten
the old Hebrew father&#8217;s parting charge: &#8220;Go!
and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey,
and the angel of God keep you company.&#8221;</p>

<p>To David this angelic companionship was no impossible
hope and reliance. As the south winds drove
him north and the west winds sent him east just
at the proper times, he believed that some wise and
powerful pilot stood at the wheel unseen; and he went
about his boat with the cheerful confidence of a child
who is sure his father can take care of him. Sometimes
he kept so close to the shore that he rippled the
shadows of the great cliffs, and sometimes he ran into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
little coves and replenished his water-casks, or bought
in the seaward clachans a supply of fresh cakes or
fish. He met no very bad weather. The unutterable
desolation of the misty miles of sullen water did give
him times of such weariness as makes the soul sink
back upon itself and retire from all hope and affection.
But such hours were evanescent; they were
usually ended by a brisk wind, bringing peril to the
little bark, and then David&#8217;s first instinct was heavenward.
He knew if the winds and waves rose mightily,
as it was their wont in that locality, there was no
human help, and his trust was instantly in the miraculous.
Such hours were, however, rare. As a general
thing the days and the nights followed each other with
a stillness and beauty full of the presence of God.
And in the sweetness of this presence he threw himself
unperplexed upon infinite love and power, and
seeking God with all his heart found him.</p>

<p>Also, he was not forgetful of the human interest of
his journey. His father had always felt himself to be
a stranger and an exile in Skye, and in his later years
the &#8220;homing&#8221; instinct for the Shetlands had been a
passionate longing, which had communicated itself to
David. He had been glad to leave Uig, for he had
not a single happy memory of the little hut in which
they two had dwelt and suffered together. As for
the bleak kirkyard, over which the great winds blew
the sea-foam, it made his heart ache to remember it.
He felt an unspeakable pity when he thought of one
of its solitary graves, and he promised himself to sail
back to Uig some day, and bring home the dust of his
father, and lay it among his kindred.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>Indeed, it was thoughts of home and kindred which
made this long, lonely voyage happy and hopeful to
David. He believed himself to be going home. Though
his father at the last had not spoken much of his cousin
Paul Borson, and though David had not found the
letter which was to be his introduction to him, yet he
had not a doubt of his welcome. Time might wither
friendship and slay love, but his kindred were always
his kindred; they were bound to him by the ineffaceable
and imperishable ties of blood and race.</p>

<p>David approached Lerwick in that divine twilight
which in the Shetland summer links day unto day;
and in its glory the ancient homes of gray and white
sandstone appeared splendid habitations. The town
was very quiet; even the houses seemed to be asleep.
He saw no living thing but a solitary sea-gull skimming
the surface of the sea; he heard nothing but a
drunken sailor fitfully singing a stave of &#8220;The Skaalds
of Foula.&#8221; The clear air, the serene seas, the tranquil
grandeur of the caverned rocks which guard the lonely
isles, charmed him. And when the sun rose and he
saw their mural fronts of porphyry, carved by storms
into ten thousand castles in the air, and cloud-like
palaces still more fantastic, he felt his heart glow for
the land of his birth and the home of his forefathers.</p>

<p>To the tumult of almost impossible hopes, he brought
in his little craft. He had felt certain that his appearance
would awaken at once interest and speculation;
that Paul Borson would hear of his arrival and come
running to meet him; that his father&#8217;s old friends,
catching the news, would stop him on the quay and
the street, and ask him questions and give him welcome.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
He had also told himself that it was likely his
father&#8217;s cousin would have sons and daughters, and if
so, that they would certainly be glad to see him; besides
which there was his mother&#8217;s family&#8211;the old
Icelandic Sabistons. He was resolved to seek them
all out, rich or poor, far or near; in his heart there
was love enough and to spare, however distant the
kinship might be.</p>

<p>For David&#8217;s conceptions of the family and racial tie
were not only founded upon the wide Hebraic ideals,
but his singularly lonely youth and affectionate nature
had disposed him to make an exaggerated estimate of
the obligations of kindred. And again, this personal
leaning was greatly strengthened by the inherited tendency
of Norse families to &#8220;stand by each other in all
haps.&#8221; Therefore he felt sure of his welcome; for,
though Paul was but his far-off cousin, they were both
Borsons, sprung from the same Norse root, children
of the same great ancestor, the wise and brave Norwegian
Bor.</p>

<p>Lying in the Bay of Lerwick, the sense of security
and of nearness to friends gave him what he had long
missed&#8211;a night of deep, dreamless sleep. When he
awoke it was late in the morning, and he had his
breakfast to prepare and every spar and sail and rope
to put in perfect order; then he dressed himself with
care, and sailed into harbor, managing his boat with a
deftness and skill he expected a town of fishermen and
sailors to take notice of. Alas, it is so difficult to find
a fortunate hour! David&#8217;s necessary delay had brought
the morning nearly to the noon, and he could hardly
have fallen on a more depressing time; for the trade
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
of the early morning was over, and the men were in
their houses taking that sleep which those who work
by night must secure in the daytime. The fishing-boats,
all emptied of their last night&#8217;s &#8220;take&#8221; and
cleaned, were idly rocking on the water. The utmost
quiet reigned in the sunny streets, and the little pier
was deserted. No one took any notice of David.</p>

<p>Greatly disappointed, and even wounded, by this
very natural neglect, David made fast his boat and
stepped on shore. He put his feet down firmly, as if
he was taking possession of his own, and stood still
and looked around. He saw a man with his hands in
his pockets loitering down the street, and he went
toward him; but as he came within speaking distance
the man turned into a house and shut the door.
Pained and curious, he continued his aimless walk.
As he passed Fae&#8217;s store he heard the confused sound
of a number of men talking, then silence, then the
tingling notes of a fiddle very cleverly played. For a
moment he was bewitched by the music; then he was
sure that nothing but the little sinful fiddle of carnal
dance and song could make sounds so full of temptation.
And as Odysseus, passing the dwelling-place of
the sirens, &#8220;closed his ears and went swiftly by, singing
the praises of the gods,&#8221; so David, remembering
his father&#8217;s counsels, closed his ears to the enchanting
strains and hastened beyond their power to charm
him.</p>

<p>A little farther on a lovely girl, with her water-pitcher
on her head and her knitting in her hands,
met him. She looked with a shy smile at David, and
the glance from her eyes made him thrill with pleasure;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
but before he had a word ready she had passed,
and he could only turn and look at her tall form and
the heavy braids of pale-brown hair below the water-pitcher.
He felt as if he were in a dream as he went
onward again down the narrow street of gray and
white houses&#8211;houses so tall, and so fantastic, and so
much larger than he had ever seen, that they impressed
him with a sense of grandeur in which he had
neither right nor place; for, though he saw women
moving about within them and children sitting on the
door-steps, no one spoke to him, no one seemed interested
in his presence; and yet he had come to them
with a heart so full of love! Never for a moment did
he reflect that his anticipations had rested only on his
own desires and imaginations.</p>

<p>His disappointment made him sorrowful, but in no
degree resentful. &#8220;It was not to be,&#8221; he decided.
Then he resolved to return to a public house he had
noticed by the pier. There he could get his dinner and
make some inquiries about his kindred. As he turned
he met face to face a middle-aged woman with a basket
of turf on her back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care, my lad,&#8221; she said cheerfully; and her
smile inspired David with confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother,&#8221; he said, doffing his cap with instinctive
politeness, &#8220;mother, I am a stranger, and I want to
find my father&#8217;s people&#8211;the Borsons. Where do they
live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lad, the sea has them. It is Paul Borson you
are asking for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went out in his boat with his four sons one
night. The boat came back empty. It is two years
since.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i4'></a><img src='images/i091.png'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;&#8216;I WANT TO FIND MY FATHER&#8217;S PEOPLE.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>&#8220;I am Liot Borson&#8217;s son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Have I any kin left?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is your far-cousin Nanna. She was Paul&#8217;s
one daughter, and he saw the sun shine through her
eyes. She is but sadly off now. Come into my house,
and I will give you a cup of tea and a mouthful of
bread and fish. Thank God, there is enough for you
and for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come,&#8221; said David, simply; and he took the
basket from the woman, and flung it lightly over his
own shoulder. Then they went together to a house
in one of the numerous &#8220;closes&#8221; running from the
main street to the ocean. It was a very small house,
but it was clean, and was built upon a rock, the foundations
of which were deep down in the sea. When
the tide was full David could have sailed his boat
under its small seaward window. It contained a few
pieces of handsome furniture, and some old Delft
earthenware which had been brought from Holland
by seafaring kindred long ago; all else savored of
narrow means.</p>

<p>But the woman set before David a pot of tea and
some oat-cake, and she fried him a fresh herring, and
he ate with the delayed hunger of healthy youth,
heartily and with pleasure. And as he did so she
talked to him of his father Liot, whom she had known
in her girlhood; and David told her of Liot&#8217;s long,
hard fight with death, and she said with a kind of sad
pride:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>&#8220;Yes; that way Liot was sure to fare to his long
home. He would set his teeth and fight for his life.
Was it always well between him and you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was hard and silent, but I could always lean
on him as much as I liked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a good deal to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they drew the past from the eternity into
which it had fallen, that they two, brought so strangely
together, might look at it between them. They talked
of Liot&#8217;s hard life and hard death for an hour, and
then the woman said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul Borson was of the same kind&#8211;silent, but full
of deeds; and his daughter Nanna, she also has a great
heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Show me now where she lives, and I will go and
see her. Also, tell me your name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Barbara Traill. When you have seen Nanna
come back here, and I will give you a place to sleep
and a little meat; and as soon as it is well with you it
will be easy to pay my charges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is no room for me in my cousin&#8217;s house I
will come back to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Barbara walked with him to the end of the street,
and pointed out a little group of huts on the distant
moor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go into the first one,&#8221; she said; &#8220;it is Nanna
Sinclair&#8217;s. And be sure and keep to the trodden path,
for outside of it there are bogs that no man knows the
bottom of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David went forward alone, and his heart fell,
and a somber look crept like a cloud over his face.
This was not the home-coming he had anticipated&#8211;this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
poor meal at a stranger&#8217;s fireside. He had been
led to think that his cousin Paul had a large house
and the touch of money-getting. &#8220;He and his will
be well off,&#8221; Liot had affirmed more than once. And
one day, while he yet could stand in the door of his
hut, he had looked longingly northward and said, &#8220;Oh,
if I could win home again! Paul would make a fourteen
days&#8217; feast to welcome me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The very vagueness of these remarks had given
strength to David&#8217;s imagination. He had hoped for
things larger than his knowledge, and he had quite
forgotten to take into his calculations the fact that
as the years wear on they wear out love and life, and
leave little but graves behind them. At this hour he
felt his destiny to be hard and unlovely, and the text
learned as one of the pillars of his faith, &#8220;Jacob have
I loved, Esau have I hated,&#8221; forced itself upon his reflection.
A deadly fear came into his heart that the
Borsons were among these hated ones. Why else did
God pursue them with such sufferings and fatalities?
And what could he do to propitiate this unfriendly
Deity?</p>

<p>His road was upon the top of the cliff, over a moor
covered with peat-bogs and withered heather. The
sea was below him, and a long, narrow lake lay silent
and motionless among the dangerous moss&#8211;a lake
so old and dead-looking that it might have been the
shadow of a lake that once was. Nothing green was
near it, and no birds were tempted by its sullen
waters; yet untold myriads of sea-birds floated and
wheeled between sea and sky, and their hungry, melancholy
cries and the desolate landscape stimulated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
and colored David&#8217;s sad musings, though he was quite
unaware of their influence.</p>

<p>When he came to the group of huts, he paused a
moment. They were the abodes of poverty; there was
none better than the rest. But Barbara had said that
Nanna&#8217;s was the first one, and he went slowly toward
it. No one appeared, though the door stood wide
open; but when he reached the threshold he could see
Nanna sitting within. She was busily braiding the
fine Tuscan straw for which Shetland was then famous,
and her eyes were so intently following her
rapid fingers that it was unlikely she had seen him
coming. Indeed, she did not raise them at once, for
it was necessary to leave her work at a certain point;
and in that moment&#8217;s delay David looked with a breathless
wonder at the woman before him.</p>

<p>She was sitting, and yet even sitting she was majestic.
Her face was large, but perfectly oval, and fair as a lily;
her bright-brown hair was parted, passed smoothly behind
the ears, and beautifully braided. Serenity and an
unalterable calm gave to the young face something of the
fixity of marble; but as David spoke she let her eyes fall
upon a little child at her feet, and then lifted them to
him with a smile as radiant and life-giving as sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; she asked, as she took her babe in
her arms and went toward David.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am your far-cousin David Borson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The son of my father&#8217;s cousin Liot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Liot Borson is dead, and here am I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are welcome, for you were to come. My father
talked often of his cousin Liot. They are both gone
away from this world.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>&#8220;I think they have found each other again. Who
can tell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the great multitude that no man can number,
it might not be easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If God willed it so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be sufficient. This is your little cousin
Vala; she is nearly two years old. Is she not very
pretty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not what to say. She is too pretty for
words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down, cousin, and tell me all.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as they talked her eyes enthralled him. They
were deep blue, and had a solar brilliancy as if they
imbibed light&#8211;holy eyes, with the slow-moving pupils
that indicate a religious, perhaps a mystical, soul.
David sat with her until sunset, and she gave him a
simple meal of bread and tea, and talked confidentially
to him of Liot and of her own father and brothers.
But of herself she said nothing at all; neither
could David find courage to ask her a single question.</p>

<p>He watched her sing her child to sleep, and he sat
down with her on the door-step, and they talked softly
together of death and of judgment to come. And the
women from the other huts gradually joined them,
and the soft Shetland night glorified the somber land
and the mysterious sea, until at last David rose and
said he must go back to Lerwick, for the day was
over.</p>

<p>A strange day it had been to him; but he was too
primitive to attempt any reasoning about its events.
When he left Nanna&#8217;s he was under that strong excitement
which makes a man walk as if he were treading
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
upon the void, and there was a hot confusion in his
thoughts and feelings. He stepped rapidly, and the
stillness of the lovely night did not soothe or reason
with him. As he approached the town he saw the
fishing-boats leaving the harbor, and in the fairy
light they looked like living things with outspread
wings. Two fishers were standing at a house door
with a woman, who was filling a glass. She held it
aloft a moment, and then gave it to one with the
words: &#8220;Death to the heads that wear no hair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The herring and the halibut, the haddock and the
sole,&#8221; answered the man; and he drank a little, and
passed it to his comrade. Then up the street they
hurried like belated men; and David felt the urging
of accustomed work, and a sense of delinquency in
his purposeless hands.</p>

<p>He found Barbara waiting. She knew that he
would not stay at Nanna Sinclair&#8217;s, and she had prepared
the room of her absent son for him. &#8220;If he can
pay one shilling a day, it will be a godsend to me,&#8221;
she thought; and when she told David so he answered,
&#8220;That is a little matter, and no doubt there will be
good between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw then that the window was open, and the
sea-water lippering nearly to the sill of it; and he
took off his bonnet, and sat down, and let the cool
breeze blow upon his hot brow. It was near midnight,
but what then? David had never been more awake
in all his life&#8211;yes, awake to his finger-tips. Yet for
half an hour he sat by the window and never opened
his mouth; and Barbara sat on the hearth, and raked
the smoldering peats together, and kept a like silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
She was well used to talk with her own thoughts, and
to utter words was no necessity to Barbara Traill;
but she knew what David was thinking of, and she
was quite prepared for the first word which parted his
set lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is my cousin Nanna a widow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where, then, is her husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can tell? He is gone away from Shetland,
and no one is sorry for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One thing is sure&#8211;Nanna is poor, and she is in
trouble. How comes that? Who is to blame in the
matter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nicol Sinclair&#8211;he, and he only. Sorrow and suffering
and ill luck of all kinds he has brought her,
and there is no help for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No help for it! I shall see about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had best let Nicol Sinclair alone. He is one
of the worst of men, a son of the devil&#8211;no, the very
devil himself. And he has your kinswoman Matilda
Sabiston at his back. All the ill he does to Nanna he
does to please her. To be sure, the guessing is not all
that way, but yet most people think Matilda is much
to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How came Nanna Borson to marry such a man?
Was not her father alive? Had she no brothers to
stand between her and this son of the Evil One?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When Nanna Borson took hold of Nicol Sinclair
for a husband she thought she had taken hold of
heaven; and he was not unkind to her until after the
drowning of her kin. Then he took her money and
traded with it to Holland, and lost it all there, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
came back bare and empty-handed. And when he
entered his home there was the baby girl, and Nanna
out of her mind with fever and like to die, and not
able to say a word this way or that. And Nicol
wanted money, and he went to Matilda Sabiston and
he got what he wanted; but what was then said no
one knows, for ever since he has hated the Borsons,
root and branch, and his own wife and child have
borne the weight of it. That is not all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me all, then; but make no more of it than it
is worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is little need to do that. Before Nanna was
strong again he sold the house which Paul Borson had
given to her as a marriage present. He sold also all
the plenishing, and whatever else he could lay his
hands on. Then he set sail; but there was little space
between two bad deeds, for no sooner was he home
again than he took the money Paul Borson had put in
the bank for his daughter, and when no one saw him&#8211;in
the night-time&#8211;he slipped away with a sound
skin, the devil knows where he went to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were there no men in Lerwick at that time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many men were in Lerwick&#8211;men, too, who never
get to their feet for nothing; and no man was so well
hated as Nicol Sinclair. But Nanna said: &#8216;I have had
sorrow enough. If you touch him you touch me ten-fold.
He has threatened me and the child with measureless
evil if I say this or that against anything he
does.&#8217; And as every one knows, when Nicol is angry
the earth itself turns inside out before him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not fear him a jot&#8211;not I!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had ever seen him swaggering and rolling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
from one day into another, if you had ever seen him
stroking his bare arms and peering round with wicked
eyes for some one to ease him of his temper, you would
not say such words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not call my words back for much more than
that, and I will follow up this quarrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are foolish, you may do so; if you are wise,
you will be neither for nor against Nicol Sinclair.
There is a wide and a safe way between these two.
Let me tell you, Nanna&#8217;s life lies in it. I have not yet
told you all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak the last word, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think what cruel things a bad man can always do
to a good woman; all of them Nicol Sinclair has done
to your cousin Nanna. Yes, it is so. When she was
too weak to hold her baby in her arms he bade her
&#8216;die, and make way for a better woman.&#8217; And one
night he lured her to the cliff-top, and then and there
he quarreled with her; and men think&#8211;yes, and
women think so too&#8211;that he threw the child into the
water, and that Nanna leaped after it. That was the
story in every one&#8217;s mouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it true? Tell me that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was more than guesswork to go on. Magnus
Crawford took them out of the sea, and the child
was much hurt, for it has never walked, nor yet spoken
a word, and there are those who say it never will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what said my cousin Nanna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She held her peace both to men and women; but
what she said to God on the matter he knows. It is
none of thy business. She has grown stronger and
quieter with every sorrow; and it is out of a mother&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
strength, I tell thee, and not her weakness, that good
can come.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David rose to his feet and began to walk furiously
about the small room. His face was white as
death, and he spoke with a still intensity, dropping
each word as if it were a separate oath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish that Sinclair were here&#8211;in this room! I
would lay his neck across my knee, and break it like
a dog&#8217;s. I would that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a joy to see thee do it. I would say,
&#8216;Well done, David Borson!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad that God has made Tophet for such
men!&#8221; cried David, passionately. &#8220;Often I have
trembled at the dreadful justice of the Holy One; I
see now how good it is. To be sure, when God puts
his hook into the nose of the wicked, and he is made
to go a way he does not want to go, then he has to
cease from troubling. But I wish not that he may
cease from being troubled. No, indeed; I wish that
he may have weeping and wailing! I will stay here.
Some day Sinclair will come back; then he shall pay
all he owes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly David remembered his father&#8217;s sad confession,
and he was silent. The drowning of Bele
Trenby and all that followed it flashed like a fiery
thought through his heart, and he went into his room,
and shut the door, and flung himself face downward
upon the floor. Would God count his anger as very
murder? Would he enter into judgment with him
for it? Oh, how should a sinful man order all his way
and words aright! And in a little while Barbara
heard him weeping, and she said to herself:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i5'></a><img src='images/i103.png'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
NANNA AND VALA
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>&#8220;He is a good man. God loves those who remember
him when they are alone and weep. The minister
said that.&#8221;</p>

<p>This day had indeed been to David a kind of second
birth. He had entered into a new life and taken possession
of himself. He knew that he was a different
being from the youth who had sailed for weeks alone
with God upon the great waters; but still he was a
riddle to himself, and it was this feeling of utter confusion
and weakness and ignorance that had sent him,
weeping and speechless, to the very feet of the divine
Father.</p>

<p>But if the mind is left quite passive we are often
instructed in our sleep. David awakened with a plan
of life clearly in his mind. He resolved to remain
with Barbara Traill, and follow his occupation of fishing,
and do all that he could to make his cousin Nanna
happy. The intense strength of his family affection
led him to this resolve. He had not fallen in love
with Nanna. As a wife she was sacred in his eyes, and
it never entered his mind that any amount of ill treatment
could lessen Sinclair&#8217;s claim upon her. But
though far off, she was his cousin; the blood of the
Borsons flowed alike through both their hearts; and
David, who could feel for all humanity, could feel
most of all for Nanna and Vala.</p>

<p>Nanna herself had acknowledged this claim. He
remembered how gladly she had welcomed him; he
could feel yet the warm clasp of her hand, and the
shining of her eyes was like nothing he had ever before
seen. Even little Vala had been pleased to lie in
his strong arms. She had put up her small mouth for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
him to kiss, and had slept an hour upon his breast.
As he thought of that kiss he felt it on his lips, warm
and sweet. Yes, indeed; there was love in that poor
little hut that David Borson could not bear to lose.</p>

<p>So he said to Barbara in the morning: &#8220;I will stay
with you while it pleases us both.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Barbara answered: &#8220;A great help and comfort
thou wilt be to me, and doubtless God sent thee.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span><a id='link_6'></a>VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>KINDRED&#8211;THE QUICK AND THE DEAD</span></h2>

<p>Shetland was, then, to be David&#8217;s
home, and he accepted the destiny
gladly. He felt near to the people, and
he admired the old gray town, with its
roving, adventurous population. His
first duty was to remove his personal belongings from
his boat to Barbara Traill&#8217;s house, and when this was
done it was easy enough to set himself to business;
for as soon as he went among the fishers and said,
&#8220;My name is Borson, and I am the son of your old
mate Liot Borson,&#8221; he found himself in a circle of
outstretched hands. And as he had brought his nets
and lines with him, he had no difficulty in getting men
who were glad to help him with his fishing, and to instruct
him in the peculiarities of the coast and the set
of its tides and currents.</p>

<p>For the rest, there was no sailor or fisher in Lerwick
who was so fearless and so wise in all sea-lore as
David Borson. Sink or swim, he was every inch a
seaman. He read the sea as a landsman reads a book;
he knew all its moods and its deceitfulness, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
more placid it was the more David mistrusted its intentions;
he was always watching it. The men of Uig
had been wont to say that David Borson would not
turn his back on the sea, lest it should get some advantage
over him. This intimacy of mistrust was the
result of his life&#8217;s training; it was the practical education
of nearly twenty years.</p>

<p>His next move was to see the minister and present
to him the letter from the minister of Uig, which authenticated
his kirk standing and his moral character.
He put on his kirk clothes for this call, and was
sorry afterward that he had so hampered himself; for
the good man met him with both hands outstretched,
and blessed him in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>&#8220;I married your father and mother, David,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I baptized you into the fold of Lerwick kirk, and I
buried your sweet mother in its quiet croft. Your
father was near to me and dear to me. A good man
was Liot Borson&#8211;a good man! When that is said,
what more is left to say? While my life-days last I
shall not forget Liot Borson.&#8221; And then they talked
of David&#8217;s life in Uig, and when he left the manse he
knew that he had found a friend.</p>

<p>It was then Thursday night, and he did not care to
go to the fishing until the following Monday. Before
he began to serve himself he wished to serve God, and
so handsel his six days&#8217; work by the blessing of the
seventh. This was the minister&#8217;s advice to him, and
he found that every one thought it right and good;
so, though he made his boat ready for sea, she was not
to try her speed and luck on her new fishing-ground
until David had offered up thanksgiving for his safe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
journey, and supplications for grace and wisdom to
guide his new life aright.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no more that I can do now until the early
tide on Monday morning,&#8221; he said to Barbara Traill,
&#8220;and I will see if I can find any more of my kin-folk.
Are any of my mother&#8217;s family yet living?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Sabistons have all gone south to the Orkneys.
They are handy at money-getting, and the rumor goes
abroad that they are rich and masterful, and ill to deal
with; but they were ever all that, or the old tellings-up
do them much wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Few people are better spoken of than they deserve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so. Yet no one in Lerwick is so well hated
as your great-aunt Matilda Sabiston. She is the last
of the family left in Shetland. Go and see her if you
wish to; I have nothing to say against it; but I can
give you a piece of advice: lean not for anything on
Matilda Sabiston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All I want of her is a little love for my mother&#8217;s
sake; so I will go and see her. For the sake of the
dead she will at least be civil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing will come of the visit. It is not to be expected
that Matilda will behave well to you, when she
behaves ill to every one else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For all that, I would like to look upon her. We
are blood-kin. I have a right to see her face; I have
a right to offer her my service and my duty; whether
she will take it or throw it from her is to be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will <i>not</i> take it. However, here is your dinner
ready, and after you have eaten it go and see your
kinswoman. You will easily find her; she lives in the
largest house in Lerwick.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>The little opposition to his desires confirmed David
in his resolve. When he had eaten, and dressed himself
in his best clothing, he went to Matilda Sabiston&#8217;s
house. It was a large stone dwelling, and had been
famous for the unusual splendor of its furnishing.
David was astonished and interested, but not in the
least abashed; for the absorbing idea in his mind was
that of kindred, and the soft carpets, the velvet-covered
chairs and sofas, the pictures and ornaments, were
only the accessories of the condition. An old woman,
grim and of few words, opened the heavy door, and
then tottered slowly along a narrow flagged passage
before him until they came to a somberly furnished
parlor, where Mistress Sabiston was sitting, apparently
asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, mistress,&#8221; said the woman. &#8220;Here be
some one that wants to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A beggar, then, either for kirk or town. I have
nothing to give.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so; he is a fair, strong lad, who says you are
his aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He lies, whoever he is. Let me see the fool,
Anita.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he is, mistress. Let him speak for himself.&#8221;
And Anita stood aside and permitted David to enter
the room.</p>

<p>Matilda sat in a large, uncushioned chair of black
wood&#8211;the chair of her fore-elder Olaf, who had made
it in Iceland from some rare drift, and brought it with
his other household goods to Shetland ten generations
past. It was a great deal too large for her shrunken
form, and her old, old face against its blackness looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
as if it had been carved out of the yellow ivory of
Sudan. Never had David seen a countenance so void
of expression; it was like a scroll made unreadable by
the wear and dust of years. Life appeared to have
retreated entirely to her eyes, which were fierce and
darkly glowing. And the weight and coldness of her
great age communicated itself; he was chilled by her
simple presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your business?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the son of your niece Karen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no niece.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea, but you have. Death breaks no kinship. It
is souls that are related, not bodies; and souls live
forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Babble! In a word, what brought you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came only to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I sent not for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet I thought you would wish to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Liot Borson is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad of it. He was a murderer while he
lived, and now I hope that he is a soul in pain forevermore.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am his son, and you must not&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what brought you here? I have hoped you
were dead for many a year. If all the Borsons, root
and branch, were gone to their father the devil, it
would be a pleasure to me. I have ever hated them;
to all who knew them they were bringers of bad luck,&#8221;
she muttered angrily, looking into David&#8217;s face with
eyes full of baleful fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet is love stronger than hate, and because my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
mother was of your blood and kin I will not hate
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear a wonder!&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;The man will
not hate me. Son of a murderer, I want not one kind
thought from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no cause to call my father what neither
God nor man has called him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cause enough! I know that right well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is only right you give proof of such assertions.
Say what you mean and be done with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you are getting angry at last. Your father
would have been spitting fire before this. But it was
not with fire he slew Bele Trenby&#8211;no, indeed; it was
with water. Did he not tell you so when he stood on
the brink of Tophet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God did not suffer his soul to be led near the awful
place. When he gave up his ghost he gave it up to
the merciful Father of spirits. It is wicked to speak
lies of the living; it is abominable and dangerous to
speak ill of the dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear neither the living nor the dead. I will say
to my last breath that Liot Borson murdered Bele
Trenby. He was long minded to do the deed; at last
he did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you alone, of all the men and women in
Lerwick, know this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That night I dreamed a dream. I saw the moss
and the black water, and Bele&#8217;s white, handsome face
go down into it. And I saw your father there. What
for? That he might do the murder in his heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The dream came from your own thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It came from Bele&#8217;s angel. The next day&#8211;yes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
and many times afterward&#8211;I took to the spot the dog
that loved Bele, and the creature whined and crouched
to his specter. Men are poor, sightless creatures; animals
see spirits where we are blind as bats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are these your proofs? Why do people suffer
you to say such things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because in their hearts they believe me. Murders
tell tales; secretly, in the night, crossing the moss,
when men are not thinking, they breathe suspicion;
they speak after being long dumb. Fifty years is not
the date of their bond. They haunt the place of their
tragedy, and men dream of the deed. So it is. The
report sticks to Liot, and more will come of it yet.
Oh, that he were in your shoes to-day! I would find
the strength to slay him, if I died and went to hell
for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Woman, why dost thou damn thyself while yet
there is a hope of mercy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mercy! What have you to do with mercy? One
thing rejoices me: it will not be long ere I meet that
blessed thrall that cursed all the generations of the
Borsons. He and I will strike hands in that quarrel;
and it shall go ill with you and your children till the
last Borson be cursed off the face of the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will flee unto the Omnipotent. He will keep
even my shadow from the evil ones that follow after.
Now I will go, for I see there is no hope of good-will
between us two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it is my advice that you go away from Shetland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I will <i>not</i> do. There are my cousins Nanna
and Vala here; and it is freely said that you have done
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
them much ill. I will stay here and do them all the
good I can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you will have Nicol Sinclair to settle with.
That is the best of my wish. Nicol Sinclair is my
third cousin, and I have given him five hundred pounds
because he hates the Borsons and is ready to cross
their happiness in all things possible. Pack, now,
from my presence! I have no more to say to you.
I am no kin to you, and I have taken good care to prevent
the law making you kin. My will is made. All
that I have not given to Nicol Sinclair goes to make
free the slaves in Africa. Freedom! freedom! freedom!&#8221;
she shrieked. &#8220;Nothing is cruel but slavery.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the old Norse passion for liberty, strong and
vital when every other love was ashes. It was a passion
also to which David instantly responded. The
slumbering sentiment awoke like a giant in his heart,
and he comprehended it by a racial instinct as passionate
as her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done well,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hunger and cold,
pain and poverty, are nothing if one has freedom. It
is a grand thing to set a man or a woman <i>free</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet you catch haddock and herring! Bah!
we have nothing to do with each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then farewell, aunt, and God give you mercy in
the day you will need mercy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was suddenly and stolidly silent. She fixed her
eyes on the dull glow of the burning peats, and relapsed
into the torpor that was her habitual mood.
Its force was insurmountable. David went slowly out
of her presence, and was unable for some time to cast
off the depression of her icy influence. Yet the meeting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
had not been without result. During it he had
felt the first conscious throb of that new passion for
freedom which had sprung into existence at the impetuous,
glowing iteration of the mere word from his
aunt&#8217;s lips. He felt its charm in the unaccustomed
liberty of his own actions. He was now entirely without
claims but those his love or liking voluntarily assumed.
No one older than himself had the right to
reprove or direct him. He had at last come to his
majority. He was master of himself and his fate.</p>

<p>The first evidence of this new condition was a dignified
reticence with Barbara Traill. She was conscious
of the change in her lodger. She felt instinctively
that he was no longer a child to be questioned,
and there was a tone of authority in his refusal to
discuss his aunt Sabiston with her which she could
not but respect. Indeed, it was no longer possible to
speak to him of Mistress Sabiston as Mistress Sabiston
deserved to be spoken of. Her first censure was
checked by David&#8217;s air of disapproval and his few
words of apology:</p>

<p>&#8220;She is, however, my aunt; and when one is ninety
years old it is a good excuse for many faults.&#8221;</p>

<p>Matilda&#8217;s utter refusal of his kin or kindness threw
him more exclusively upon Nanna and her child. And
as all his efforts to discover any other family connections
were quite futile, he finally came to believe that
they three were the last of a family that had once filled
the lands of the Norsemen with the fame of their great
deeds. Insensibly this thought drew the bond tighter
and closer, though an instinct as pure as it was conventional
taught him a scrupulous delicacy with regard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
to this friendship. Fortunately, in Shetland the
blood-tie was regarded as a strong enough motive for
all David&#8217;s attentions to a woman and child so desolate
and helpless. People said simply, &#8220;It is a good thing
for Nanna Sinclair that her cousin has come to Shetland.&#8221;
And it did not enter their hearts to imagine
an evil motive for kind deeds when there was one so
natural and obligatory.</p>

<p>So Shetland became dear and pleasant to David, and
he gradually grew into great favor. The minister
made much of the young man, for he respected his
integrity and earnest piety, and loved him for that
tenderness and clearness of conscience which was sensitive
to the first approaches of wrong. The fishers
and sailors of the town gave him a warm admiration
for his seamanship, and the praise David had looked
for at the beginning, and felt disappointed in not receiving,
was now given him by a kind of acclamation.
Old sailors, telling yarns of their ships and the queer,
bold things their ships had done, generally in some
way climaxed their narratives by an allusion to David
Borson. Thus, Peter Redlands, talking to a group of
fishers one day, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where that lad learned the sea, and who taught
him all the ways of it, is beyond me; but say as you
will, he can make harbor when none of us could look
at it. It is my belief David Borson can stick to anything
that can float.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to see how he humors a boat,&#8221; continued Jan
Wyck, &#8220;you would think she was made out of flesh
instead of out of three-inch planks. I was out with
him near the Old Man&#8217;s Rocks last week, and he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
watching the water; and I said, &#8216;What is it, David?&#8217;
&#8216;The sea,&#8217; he said. &#8216;It will be at its old tricks again
in an hour or less.&#8217; And the &#8216;less&#8217; was right, for in
fifteen minutes the word was, &#8216;Reef, and quick about
it!&#8217; and then you know what&#8211;the rip and the roar,
and the boat leaping her full length. But David did
not worry a jot. He coaxed her beautifully, and kept
her well in hand; and she shook herself a little, and
then away like a gull before the wind.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was just as popular among the children and
women of Lerwick. The boys made an idol of him,
for David was always ready to give them a sail, or lend
them his fowling-piece, or help them to rig their toy
boats. As for the maidens, the prettiest ones in Lerwick
had a shy smile for David Borson, and many
wondered that such a beauty as Asta Fae should smile
on him in vain; but David had taken Nanna and Vala
into his heart, and his care and thought for them were
so constant that there was no room for any other interest.
Yet Barbara often talked to him about taking
a wife; and even the minister, doubtless led to such
advice by female gossip and speculation, thought it
well to speak a word on the subject to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, David,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there are good girls
and beautiful girls that look kindly on you, and who
wonder that your smiles are so cold and your words
so few; and it is my duty to say to you that evil may
come of your taking so much thought for your cousin
and her child, and the way to help her best is to help
her through your own wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not in the mind to marry, minister,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;There is no one girl dearer or fairer to me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
than another. And as for what I do for my cousins,
I think that God sent me to do it, and I shall not be
feared to make accounting to him for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is my belief also, David. Yet we are told to
avoid the very appearance of evil; and what is more,
if it is not your pleasure to marry, it is your duty;
and how will you win past that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not seen it to be my duty, minister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The promise is in the line of the righteous; the
blessing is for you and for your children; but if you
have no wife or children, then is the promise shortened
and the blessing cut off. I think that you should
choose some good woman&#8217;s daughter, and build yourself
a home, and then marry a wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man went out of the manse with this
thought in his heart. And not far off he met pretty
Asta Fae, and he spoke to her and walked with her as
far as she was going; and he saw that she had the
sweetest of blue eyes, and that her smile was tender
and her ways gentle. And when he left her at her
father&#8217;s door, he held her hand a moment and said,
&#8220;It has been a pleasant walk to me, Asta.&#8221; And she
looked frankly into his face and answered with rosy
blushes, &#8220;And to me also, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a warm glow at his heart as he went
across the moor to Nanna&#8217;s; and he resolved to tell
his cousin what the minister had said, and ask her
advice about Asta Fae; but when he reached Nanna&#8217;s
cot she was sitting on the hearth with Vala upon her
knees, and telling her such a strange story that David
would not for anything lose a word of it. And as
Nanna&#8217;s back was to the open door she did not see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
David enter, but went on with her tale, in the high,
monotonous tone of one telling a narrative whose
every word is well known and not to be changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Vala,&#8221; she said, touching the child&#8217;s fingers
and toes, &#8220;it was the old brown bull of Norraway, and
he had a sore battle with the deil, and he carried off
a great princess; and you may know how big he was,
for he said to her, &#8216;Eat out of my left ear, and drink
out of my right ear, and put by the leavings.&#8217; And
ay they rode, and on they rode, till they came to a
dark and awesome glen, and there the bull stopped
and the lady lighted down. And the bull said to her:
&#8216;Here you must stay while I go on and fight the deil.
And you must sit here on that stone, and move not
hand or foot till I come back, or else I&#8217;ll never find
you again. And if everything round about you turns
blue, I shall have beaten the deil; but if all things
turn red, then the deil will have conquered me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so he left her, mammy, to go and fight the deil?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, he did, Vala; and she sat still, singing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sing me the lady&#8217;s song, mammy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Nanna intoned softly the strangest, wildest
little tune. It was like a Gregorian chant, and had but
three notes, but to these she gave a marvelous variety.
David listened spellbound to the entreating voice:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Seven long years I served for thee,</p>
<p>The glassy hill I clamb for thee,</p>
<p>The bloody shirt I wrang for thee,</p>
<p>And wilt thou not waken and come to me?&#8217;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>But I&#8217;m thinking he never came back to the lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he did, mammy,&#8221; said Vala, confidently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
&#8220;Helga Storr told me he came back a fine prince
with a gold crown on his head, and the deil went
away empty and roaring mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it you are telling about, Nanna?&#8221; said
David, his face eager and alight with interest.</p>

<p>She rose up then, with Vala in her arms, her eyes
shining with her sweet, motherly story-telling. &#8220;It is
only an old tale, David,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I know not
who made it up. My mother told it to me, and her
mother to her, and so back through years that none
can count. Yes, indeed; what little child does not
know the story of the big brown bull of Norraway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of it before,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure; your mother did not live to talk to
you&#8211;poor little lad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then, Nanna, tell it to me for my mother&#8217;s
sake.&#8221; And he sat down on the cricket by her side,
and took Vala on his knee; and Nanna laughed, and
then, with the little formal importance of the reciter,
said: &#8220;Well, so it shall be, then. Here beginneth the
story of the big brown bull of Norraway and his fight
with the deil.&#8221; And the old tale fell from her lips
full of charm, and David listened with all the delight
of a child. And when it had been twice told, Nanna
began to talk of the burnt Njal and the Icelandic
sagas, and the more so as she saw David was full of
strange wonder and delight, and that every word was
fresh and enthralling to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet it is a thing to be wondered at,&#8221; she said
finally, &#8220;that you, David, know not these old histories
better than I do; for I have often heard that no one
in all the islands could tell a story so well as Liot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
Borson. Yes, and the minister once said, and I heard
him, that he would walk ten miles to hear from your
father&#8217;s lips once more the sad happenings of his ancestor,
the brave, helpful Gisli.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a great thing to me, Nanna,&#8221; answered
David, in a voice low and quiet, for he was feeling
deeply. &#8220;And I look to you now for what has
never been told me. Who, then, was my ancestor
Gisli?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your father held his peace about him, he surely
thought it best to do so, and so ask me not to break a
good resolve.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nay, but I must ask you. My heart burns; I feel
that there is a life behind me into which I must look.
Help me, Nanna. And, more, the name Gisli went to
my head. It is not like other strange names. I love
this man whom I have not seen and never heard of
until this hour. What has he to do with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>He was one of us.</i> And because he was so good and
great the thrall&#8217;s curse fell the harder on him, and was
the more regarded&#8211;hard enough it has been on all the
Borsons; and perhaps your father thought it was well
you heard not of it. Many a time and oft I have
wished it had not entered my ears; for when one
sorrow called to another sorrow, and one wrong trod
on the heels of another wrong, I have been angry at
the false, ungrateful man who brought such ill fortune
upon his unborn generations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you make me so anxious and wilful that
nothing but the story of the thrall&#8217;s curse will do for
me. I shall not eat or sleep till I hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a tale of dishonor and unthankfulness, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
not so well known to me as to Jorn Thorkel. He can
tell it all, and will gladly do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But for all that, I will hear it from you, Nanna,
and you only, for it concerns us only. Tell me what
you know, and the rest can wait for Jorn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, then, you will have it; but if ill comes of the
knowledge do not blame me. It began in the days of
Harold Fairhair, one thousand years ago. There was
a Gisli then, and he had a quarrel with a berserker
called Bjorn, and they agreed to fight until one was
dead. And the woman who loved Gisli told him that
her foster-father, Kol, who was a thrall, had a sword
that whoever wielded would win in any fight. And
Gisli sent for Kol and asked him:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hast thou ever a good sword?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Kol answered: &#8216;Many things are in the
thrall&#8217;s cot, not in the king&#8217;s grange.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Lend me thy sword for my duel with Bjorn,&#8217; said
Gisli.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Kol said: &#8216;Then this thing will happen: thou
wilt never wish to give it up. And yet I tell thee, this
sword will bite whatever it falls on, nor can its edge
be deadened by spells, for it was forged by the dwarfs,
and its name is Graysteel. And make up thy mind,&#8217;
he said, &#8216;that I will take it very ill indeed if I get not
my sword back when I ask for it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Gisli took the sword and slew Bjorn with it,
and got good fame for this feat. And time rolled on,
and he gave not back the sword; and one day Kol met
him, and Gisli had Graysteel in his hand, and Kol had
an ax.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Kol asked if the sword had done him good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
service at his great need, and Gisli was full of its
praises.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, now,&#8217; said Kol, &#8216;I should like it back.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sell it to me,&#8217; said Gisli.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said Kol.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will give thee thy freedom for it,&#8217; said Gisli.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will not sell it,&#8217; said Kol.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will also give thee land and sheep and cattle and
goods as much as thou wantest,&#8217; said Gisli.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I will not sell it a whit more for that,&#8217; said Kol.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Put thy own price on it in money, and I will get
thee a fair wife also,&#8217; said Gisli.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There is no use talking about it,&#8217; said Kol. &#8216;I
will not sell it, whatsoever thou offerest. It has come
to what I said would happen: that thou wouldst not
give me back my weapon when thou knewest what virtue
was in it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;And I too will say what will happen,&#8217; said Gisli.
&#8216;Good will befall neither of us; for I will <i>not</i> give up
the sword, and it shall never come into any man&#8217;s hand
but mine, if I have my will.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Kol lifted his ax, and Gisli drew Graysteel,
and they smote at each other. Kol&#8217;s blow fell on
Gisli&#8217;s head, so that it sank into the brain; and Graysteel
fell on Kol&#8217;s head, and his skull was shattered,
and Graysteel broke asunder. Then, as Kol gave up
the ghost, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It had been better that thou hadst given me my
sword when I asked for it, for this is only the beginning
of the ill fortune I will bring on thy kith and kin
forever.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so it has been. For a thousand years the tellings-up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
of our family are full of troubles that this
thrall&#8217;s curse has brought upon us. Few of our men
have grown gray-headed; in the sea and on the battlefield
they have found their graves; and the women have
had sorrow in marriage and death in child-bearing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an evil deed,&#8221; said David.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a great curse for it also; one thousand
years it has followed Gisli&#8217;s children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so! I believe it not! Neither the dead nor the
living can curse those whom God blesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet always the Borsons have had the worst of ill
fortune. We three only are now left of the great earls
who ruled in Surnadale and in Fjardarfolk, and see
how poor and sorrowful we are. My life has been
woven out of grief and disappointment; Vala will
never walk; and as for your own youth, was it not
labor and sorrow only?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe not in any such spaedom. I believe in
God the Father Almighty, and in Jesus Christ, and in
the Holy Ghost. And as for the cursing of man, dead
or alive, I will not fear what it can do to me. Gisli
was indeed well served for his mean, ungrateful deed,
and it would have been better if the berserker Bjorn
had cut his false heart out of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such talk is not like you, David. I can see now
that your father did right to keep these bloody stories
from your hearing. There is no help in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I know not that. This night the minister
was talking to me about taking a wife. If there be
truth or power in Kol&#8217;s curse, why should any Borson
be born, that he or she may bear his spite? No; I
will not marry, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>&#8220;In saying that you mock your own words. Where,
then, is your trust in God? And the minister is
right; you ought to take a wife. People think wrong
of a young man who cannot fix his heart on one good
woman. There is Christina Hey. Speak to her.
Christina is sweet and wise, and will make a good
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I met Asta Fae as I came here. Very pretty indeed
is her face, and she has a way to win any heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For all that, I do not think well of Asta. She is
at the dance whenever there is one, and she has more
lovers than a girl should have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Christina has land and money. I care not for
a wife who is richer than myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her money is nothing against her; it will be a
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not,&#8221; he answered, but without interest.
&#8220;You have given me something to think of that is
better than wooing and wedding, Nanna. My heart
is quite full. I am more of a man than I have ever
been. I can feel this hour that there is life behind me
as well as before me. But I will go now, for to-morrow
is the Sabbath and we shall meet at the kirk; and
I will carry Vala home for you if you say so, Nanna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;to-morrow is not here,
David; but it will come, by God&#8217;s leave. I dreamed
a dream last night, and I look for a change, cousin.
But this or that, my desire is that God would choose
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That also is my desire,&#8221; said David, solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for me, I have fallen into a great strait; only
God can help me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>She was standing on the hearth, looking down at
Vala. Tears were in her eyes, and a divine pity and
sorrow made tender and gentle her majestic beauty.
David looked steadily at her, and something, he knew
not what, seemed to pierce his very soul&#8211;a sweet,
aching pain, never felt before, inexplicable, ineffable,
and as innocent as the first holy adoration of a little
child. Then he went out into the still, starry night,
and tried to think of Christina Hey; but she constantly
slipped from his consciousness, like a dream that has
no message.</p>

<p>David Borson was stirred to the very
seat of life by the things Nanna had told
him. It did not enter his heart to doubt
their truth. The shameful deed of the
first Gisli, and the still strong order of
its consequences, which neither the guilt of his children
hastened, nor their innocence delayed, nor their
expiation arrested, was the dominant feeling aroused
by her narrative. The whole story, with its terrible
Nemesis, fitted admirably into the system of Calvinistic
theology, and David had not yet come to the
hour in which faith would crush down fatalism. The
words of these ancient sagas went singing and swinging
through his brain and heart, and life seemed so
wonderful and bewildering, its sorrows so great and
certain, its needs so urgent and present, and heaven,
alas! so far off.</p>

<p>There came to him also, as he slowly trod the lonely
moor, the most awful of all conceptions of eternity&#8211;the
revelation of <i>a repentance that could undo nothing</i>.
He was righteously angry at Gisli&#8217;s base ingratitude;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
he was sorry for his sin; but others had doubtless felt
the same anger and sorrow, and it had been ineffectual.
Helpless and passive in the hands of destiny, a nameless
dread, an urgent want of help and comfort, forced
him to feel out into the abyss for something more than
flesh and blood to lean on; and then he found that
God is best of all approached in indefinite awe and
worship, and that moments of tender, vague mystery,
haunted by uncertain presentiments, bring him near.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; he said as he came to the door of his
house, &#8220;the wicked may be a rod, and smite for generations;
but the rod is in the hand of God, and I will remind
myself that my God is the Everlasting, Almighty,
Infinite One; and I will ask him to give sentence with
me, and to deliver me from the wicked, whether they
be in the body or out of the body.&#8221; And he walked
through the house-place where Barbara was sitting,
and saw her not; for he was saying to himself, &#8220;&#8216;Why
art thou so vexed, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
within me? O put thy trust in God: for I
will yet give him thanks, which is the help of my
countenance, and my God.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Nanna sat motionless for long after David left her.
She had many causes for anxiety. She was fearful of
losing her work, and absolute poverty would then be
her lot. It was a fear, however, and not a certainty;
and after a little reflection she also threw her care
upon the Preserver of men. &#8220;Be at peace,&#8221; she said
to her heart. &#8220;God feeds the gulls and the ravens,
and he will not starve Nanna and Vala.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was harder to combat her spiritual anxieties. She
was sorry she had told David about the thrall&#8217;s curse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
Her first instinct was to ask his father and mother to
forgive her; then she suddenly remembered that praying
to or for the dead was a sin for a kirk session to
meet on. And this thought led her easily to the dream
that had troubled her last night&#8217;s sleep and made her
day dark with sorrowful fears. All her life she had
possessed something of that sixth sense by which we
see and anticipate things invisible. And it is noticeable
that many cripples have often a seraphic intelligence,
a far-reaching vision, and very sensitive spiritual
aptitudes. Vala was of this order. She too had been
singularly depressed; she had seen more than she
could tell; she was as restless and melancholy as birds
just before their migrations, and she looked at her
mother with eyes so wistful, so full of inquiry, so &#8220;far
off,&#8221; that Nanna trembled under their fearfully prescient
intimations. Alas for the dangerous happiness
of maternity! How prodigious are its inquietudes!
How uncertain its consolations!</p>

<p>She told David that she had dreamed a dream, and
that she looked for a change; and she had made this
statement as simply and as confidently as if she had
said, &#8220;The wind is from the north, and I look for a
storm.&#8221; Repeated experiences had taught her, as they
teach constantly, that certain signs precede certain
events, and that certain dreams are dictated by that
delicate antenna of spiritual instinct which feels danger
to be near and warns of it.</p>

<p>Nanna had had <i>the dream</i> that ever forecast her
misfortunes, and she sat thinking of its vague intimations,
and tightening her heart for any sorrow. She
had been forewarned that she might be forearmed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
and she regarded this warning as a mark of interest
and favor from beyond the veil. God had always
spoken to his children in dreams and by the oracles
that abide in darkness, and Nanna knew that in many
ways &#8220;dreams are large possessions.&#8221; She fell asleep
pondering what her vision of the preceding night might
mean, and awoke next morning, while it was still dark,
with a dim sense of fear and sorrow encompassing
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But everything frightens one when night, the unknown,
takes the light away,&#8221; she thought. And she
rose and lighted a lamp, and looked at Vala. The
child was in a deep and healthy slumber, and the sight
of its face calmed and satisfied her. Yet she was
strangely apprehensive, and there was a weight on her
heart that made her faint and trembling. She knew
right well that some hitherto unknown sorrow was
creeping like a mist over her life, and she had not yet
the strength and the pang of conflict.</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>Have we not too? Yes, we have</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Answers, and we know not whence;</p>
<p>Echoes from beyond the grave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognized intelligence.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Yet the secret silence of the night, the vague terror
and darkness of that occult world which we all carry
with us, created in her, at first, fear, and then a kind
of angry, desperate resentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how helpless I am!&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;I can think
and feel, I can fear and love, and I am not here by my
own will; I did not place myself here; I cannot keep
myself here. My life is in the grasp of a Power I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
cannot control. What am I to do? What can I do?
Oh, how miserable I am! All my life long I have seen
&#8217;<i>Not for you</i>&#8217; written on all I wished. Life is very
hard,&#8221; she said with a little sob. And then she made
no further complaint, but her heart grew so still, she
was sure something must have died there. Alas! was
it hope?</p>

<p>&#8220;Life is very hard.&#8221; With these words she lay
down again, and between sleeping and waking the
hours wore on, and she rose at last from her shivery
sleep, even later than usual. Then she hurried breakfast
a little, and as the light grew over land and sea
she tidied her room and dressed Vala and herself for
the kirk. As the sound of the first service bell traveled
solemnly over the moor she was ready to leave the
house. Her last duty was to put a peat or two upon
the fire, and as she was doing this she heard some
one lift the sneck and push open the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is David to carry Vala,&#8221; she thought. &#8220;How
good he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when she turned she saw that it was not David.
It was her husband, Nicol Sinclair. He walked
straight to the fireside, and sat down without a word.
Nanna&#8217;s heart sank to its lowest depths, and a cold
despair made her feet and hands heavy as lead; but
she slowly spread the cloth on the table, and bit by
bit managed to recollect the cup and saucer, the barley-cake,
the smoked goose, and the tea.</p>

<p>There was a terrible account between the man sitting
on the hearth and herself, and words of passionate
reproach burned at her lips; but she held her peace.
Long ago she had left her cause with God; he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
plead it thoroughly. Even now, when her enemy
was before her, she had no thought of any other advocate.</p>

<p>Her pallor, her slow movements, her absolute dumbness,
roused in Sinclair an angry discomfort. And
when Vala made a movement he lifted her roughly,
and with a brutal laugh said, &#8220;A nice plaything you
will be on board the <i>Sea Rover</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nanna shivered at the words. She comprehended
in a moment the torture this man had probably come
purposely to inflict upon her. Already his cruel hands
had crippled her child; and what neglect, what terrors,
what active barbarities, might he not impose on the
little one in the hell of his own ship! Who there
could prevent him? Little did Nicol Sinclair care for
public opinion on land; but out at sea, where Vala&#8217;s
tears and cries could bring her no help, what pitiless
inhumanities might he not practise?</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Fly with the child!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were struck upon her heart like blows.
But how should she fly? and where to? Far or near,
the law would find her out and would give Vala to her
father&#8217;s authority. And she had no friend strong
enough to protect her. Only by death could she defy
separation. Thus, while she was pouring the boiling
water on the tea-leaves, she was revolving questions
more agonizing than words have power to picture.</p>

<p>At length the food was on the table, and, save for
those few threatening words, the silence was unbroken.
Sinclair sat down to his meal with a bravado very
near to cursing, and at that moment the kirk bells
began to ring again. To Nanna they were like a voice
from heaven. Quick as thought she lifted her child
and fled from the house.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i6'></a><img src='images/i133.png'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;BUT SHE HELD HER PEACE.&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>Oh, what stress of life and death was in her footsteps!
Only to reach the kirk! If she could do that,
she would cling to the altar and die there rather than
surrender Vala to unknown miseries. Love and terror
gave her wings. She did not turn her head; she
did not feel the frozen earth or the cutting east wind;
she saw nothing but Vala&#8217;s small face on her breast,
and she heard nothing but the echo in her heart of
those terrible words threatening her with the loss of
her child.</p>

<p>When she reached the kirk the service had begun.
The minister was praying. She went into the nearest
pew, and though all were standing, she laid Vala on
the seat, and slipped to her knees beside her. She
could not now cry out as she longed to do, and sob
her fright and anguish away at God&#8217;s feet. &#8220;Folk
would wonder at me. I would disturb the service.&#8221;
These were her thoughts as soon as the pressure of
her flight was over. For the solemn voice of the
minister praying, the strength of numbers, the holy
influence of the time and place, cooled her passionate
sense of wrong and danger, and she was even a little
troubled at her abandonment of what was usual and
Sabbath-like.</p>

<p>The altar now looked a long way off; only Sinclair
at touch could have forced her down that guarded
aisle to its shelter. Heaven itself was nearer, and
God needed no explanations. He knew all. What
was the law of man to him? And he feared not their
disapproval. Thus in her great strait she overleaped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
her creed, and cast herself on him who is &#8220;a God of
the afflicted, an helper of the oppressed, an upholder
of the weak, a protector of the forlorn, a savior of
them that are without hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the preaching was over David and Barbara
came to her; and David knit his brows when he saw
her face, for it was the face of a woman who had seen
something dreadful. Her eyes were full of fear and
anguish, and she was yet white and trembling with
the exertion of her hard flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna,&#8221; he said, &#8220;what has happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My husband has come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard last night that his ship was in harbor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has come for Vala. He will take her from me.
She will die of neglect and hard usage. He may give
her to some stranger who will be cross to her. O
David! David!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He shall not touch her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O David!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put her in my arms <i>now</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I trust you, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may put it to any proof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pass your word to me, cousin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As the Lord God Almighty lives, I will put my
life between Vala and Nicol Sinclair!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take her to sea if necessary, for my boat can
go where few will dare to follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he turned to Barbara and said: &#8220;Nicol Sinclair
has indeed come back. He says he has come for Vala.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i7'></a><img src='images/i137.png'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
AT THE KIRK.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>&#8220;Then the devil has led him here,&#8221; answered Barbara,
flashing into anger. &#8220;As for Vala, let her stay
with me. She has a good guard at my house. There
is Groat and his four sons on one side, and Jeppe
Madson and his big brother Har on the other side;
and there is David Borson, who is worth a whole ship&#8217;s
crew, to back them in anything for Vala&#8217;s safety.
Stay with me to-day, Nanna, and we will talk this
matter out.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Nanna shook her head in reply. As she understood
it, duty was no peradventure; it was an absolute
thing from which there was no turning away. And
her duty was to be at home when her husband was
there. But she put Vala&#8217;s hand into David&#8217;s hand,
and then looked at the young man with eyes full of
anxiety. He answered the look with one strong word:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Yes!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>And she knew he would redeem it with his life, if
that should be necessary.</p>

<p>Then she turned homeward, and walked with a
direct and rapid energy. She put away thought; she
formed no plan, she said no prayer. Her petition had
been made in the kirk; she thought there would be a
want of faith in repeating a request already promised.
She felt even the modesty of a suppliant, and would
not continually press into the presence of the Highest;
for to the reverent there is ever the veil before the
Shechinah.</p>

<p>And this conscious putting aside of all emotion
strengthened her. When she saw her home she had
no need to slacken her speed or to encourage herself.
She walked directly to the door and opened it. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
was no one there; the place was empty. The food on
the table was untouched. Nothing but a soiled and
crumpled handkerchief remained of the dreadful visitor.
She lifted it with the tongs and cast it into the
fire. Then she cleared away every trace of the rejected
meal.</p>

<p>Afterward she made some inquiries in the adjoining
huts. One woman only had seen his departure. &#8220;I
could not go to kirk this morning,&#8221; she said with an
air of apology, &#8220;for my bairn is very sick; and I saw
Nicol Sinclair go away. It was near the noon hour.
Drunk he was, and worse drunk than most men can
be. His face was red as a hot peat, and he swayed to
and fro like a boat on the Gruting Voe. There was
something no&#8217; just right about the man.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was all she could learn, and she was very unhappy,
for she could imagine no good reason for his
departure. In some way or other he was preparing
the blow he meant to deal her; and though it was the
Sabbath, there would be no difficulty in finding men
whom he could influence. And there was also his
cousin Matilda Sabiston, that wicked old woman who
had outlived all human passions but hatred. Against
this man and the money and ill-will that would back
him she could do nothing, but she &#8220;trusted in God
that he would deliver her.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she said to herself, &#8220;Patience&#8221;; and she sat
down to wait, shutting her eyes to the outside world,
and drawing to a focus all the strength that was in
her. The closed Bible lay on the table beside her, and
occasionally she touched it with her hand. She had
not been able to read it; but there was comfort in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
seeing the old, homely-looking book, with its everyday
aspect and its pages full of kindly blessing, and
still more comfort in putting herself in physical contact
with its promises. They seemed to be more real.
And as she sat hour after hour, psalms learned years
before, and read many and many a time without apprehension
of their meaning, began to speak to her.
She saw the words with her spiritual sight, and they
shone with their own glory. And she obtained what
she so sorely needed:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>A little comforting shadow</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;From the hot sun&#8217;s fiery glow;</p>
<p>A little rest by the fountain</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the waters of comfort flow.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>When midnight struck she looked at the clock and
thanked God. Surely she was safe for that night;
and she turned the key in her door and went to sleep.
And her sleep was that which God giveth to his beloved
when they are to be strengthened for many days&#8211;a
deep, dreamless suspense of all thought and feeling.</p>

<p>Yet, heavenly as the sleep had been, the awakening
was a shock. And as the day grew toward noon she
was as much troubled by the silence of events as her
husband had been by the silence of her lips. Human
hearts are nests of fear. Her whole soul kept going
to the window, and she said, with the impatience of
suspended suffering, &#8220;<i>Now! now!</i> I have no fortitude
for to-morrow, but I can bear anything <i>now</i>.&#8221;
Finally she resolved to go to Barbara&#8217;s, and see Vala,
and hear whatever there was to hear. But as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
was putting on her cloak she saw David coming over
the moor, and he was carrying Vala in his arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I see that I will not need to run after
my fate; it will come to me; and there will be no use
striving against it. For what must be is sure to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she turned back into the house, and David
followed with unusual solemnity, and laid Vala upon
her bed. &#8220;She is sleeping,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and there is
something to tell you, Nanna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About my husband?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say it out at once, then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night he was carried to his own ship.&#8221; And
David&#8217;s face was grave almost to sternness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Carried! Have you then hurt him, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he is a self-hurter. But this is what I know.
He went from here to Matilda Sabiston&#8217;s house. She
had gone to kirk with two of her servants, and when
she came back she found him delirious on the sofa.
Then the doctor was sent for, and when he said the
word &#8216;typhus,&#8217; Matilda shrieked with passion, and demanded
that he should be instantly taken away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But no! Surely not!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it was so. Both the minister and the doctor
said it was right and best for him to be taken to his
own ship. The town&#8211;yes, indeed, and the whole
islands were in danger. And when they took him on
board the <i>Sea Rover</i>, they found that two of the sailors
were also very ill with the fever. They had been ill
for a week, and Sinclair knew it; yet he came among
the boats, and went through the town, speaking to
many people. It was a wicked thing for him to do.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>&#8220;It was just like him. Where is the <i>Sea Rover</i> now
lying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has been taken to the South Voe. The fishing-boats
will watch lest the men are landed, and the
doctor will go to the ship every day the sea will let
him go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David, is it my duty&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it is not; there are five men with Sinclair.
Three of them are, I believe, yet well men, and three
can care for the sick and the ship. On the deck of the
<i>Sea Rover</i> a woman should not put her foot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But a ship with typhus on board?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is a hell indeed! In this case, Nanna, it is a hell
of their own making. They got the fever in a dance-house
at Rotterdam. Sinclair knew of its presence,
and laughed it to scorn. It was his mate who told
the doctor so. Also, Nanna, there is Vala.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went swiftly to the side of the sleeping child,
and she was sure there was a change in her. David
would not acknowledge it, but in forty-eight hours the
signs of the fatal scourge were unmistakable. Then
Nanna&#8217;s house was marked and isolated, and she sat
down to watch her dying child.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span><a id='link_8'></a>VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE JUSTIFICATION OF DEATH</span></h2>

<p>During the awful days of Vala&#8217;s dying
no one came near Nanna. She watched
her child night and day, and saw it go
out into the darkness that girds our
life around, in unutterable desolation of
soul. From the first Vala was unconscious, and she
went away without a word or token of comfort to the
despairing mother. There was unspeakable suffering
and decay, and then the little breathing-house in which
Vala had sojourned a short space was suddenly vacant.
For a moment Nanna stood on the border-lands of
being, where life hardly draws breath. <i>A little more</i>,
and she would have pushed apart the curtains that
divide us from that spiritual world which lies so close
and which may claim us at any moment. <i>A little more</i>,
and she would, in her loving agony, have pressed
beyond manifestations to that which is ineffable and
nameless.</p>

<p>But at the last moment the flesh-and-blood conductor
of spirit failed; a great weakness and weariness
made her passive under the storm of sorrow that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
drove like rain to the roots of her life. When she
was able to move, Vala lay sad and still. All was
over, and Nanna stood astonished, smitten, dismayed,
on a threshold she could not pass. The Eternal had
given, and it was a gift; he had taken away, and it
was an immeasurable loss, and she could not say,
&#8220;Blessed be the name of the Lord.&#8221; She was utterly
desolate; and when she washed for the last time the
little feet that had never trod the moor or street or
house, she thought her heart would break. <i>Who</i> had
led them through the vast spaces of the constellations?
<i>Whither</i> had they been led? There was no answer to
her moaning question. She looked from her dead
Vala to God, and all was darkness. She could not
see him.</p>

<p>It was a hurried burial in a driving storm. The sea
rolled in fateful billows, the winds whistled loud and
shrill, the rain soaked Nanna through and through.
Two or three of her neighbors followed afar off; they
wished her to see they were not oblivious of her grief
and loss, but they dared not break the ordinance of
town and kirk and voluntarily and without urgent
reason come in contact with the contagion; for the
island not many years previously had been almost
decimated by the same scourge, and every man and
woman was the guardian, not only of his or her own
life, but of the lives of the community.</p>

<p>Nanna understood this. She saw the dark, cloaked
figures of her friends standing in the storm at a distance,
and she knew the meaning of their upraised
hands; but she had no heart to answer the signal of
sympathy. Alone, she stood by the small open grave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
and saw it filled. The rain beat on it, and she was
glad that it beat on her. It was with difficulty, and
only with some affected anger, the two men who had
buried the child got her to return to her home.</p>

<p>How vacant it was! How unspeakably lonely!
The stormy dreariness outside the cot, the atmosphere
of sorrow and loss within it, were depressing
beyond words. And what can be said of the loneliness
and sorrow within the soul? But in every bitter
cup there is one drop bitterest of all; and in Nanna&#8217;s
case this was David&#8217;s neglect and apparent desertion.
She had received no message from him, nor had he
come near her in all her trouble. Truly, he must have
broken the law to do so; but Nanna was sure no town
ordinance would have kept her from David&#8217;s side in
such an hour, and she despised that obedience to law
which could teach him such cowardly neglect.</p>

<p>Day after day passed, and he came not. The fever
was by this time in all the cottages around her, and
the little hamlet was a plague-spot that every one
avoided. But, for all that, Nanna&#8217;s heart condemned
her cousin. She tried him by her own feelings, and
found him guilty of unpardonable selfishness and
neglect. And oh, how dreary are those waste places
left by the loved who have deserted us! With what
bitter tears we water them! Vala and David had been
her last tie to love and happiness. &#8220;Thank God,&#8221; she
cried out in her misery, &#8220;it can only be broken once!&#8221;</p>

<p>Vala had been in her grave a week&#8211;a week of days
that turned the mother&#8217;s heart gray&#8211;before Nanna
heard a word of comfort. Then once more David lifted
the latch of the cot and entered her presence. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
was sitting still and empty-handed, and her white
face and the quivering of her lips pierced him to the
heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna! Nanna!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Then she rose, and looked round the lonely room,
and David understood what she meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna! Nanna!&#8221; was still all that he could say.
He could find no words fit for such sorrow; but there
was the truth to speak, and that might have some
comfort in it. So he took her hands in his, and said
gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna! dear Nanna! your husband is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad of it!&#8221; she answered. &#8220;He killed Vala
twice over.&#8221; Her voice was low and weary, and she
asked no question about the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you think I had forgotten you, Nanna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgotten you and Vala?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looked most like it. I thought you were either
feared for yourself or the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder men think ill of God, whom they do
not know, when they are so ready to think ill of men,
whom they do know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O David! how could you desert me? Can you
think of all that I have suffered alone? God nor man
has helped me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor, poor Nanna!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you had been ill to death, neither the words of
men nor the power of the law could have kept me
from your sick-bed. No, indeed! I would have risked
everything to help you. Where were you at all,
David?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>&#8220;I was on the <i>Sea Rover</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Sea Rover</i>! That is Nicol&#8217;s ship. What did
he do to you? What were you there for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on the <i>Sea Rover</i> nursing your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the truth, Nanna. I have just finished my
task.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who sent you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The minister came to me with the order, and I
could not win by it and face God and man again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What said he? O David! David!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said, &#8216;David Borson, there are four men ill
with typhus this morning on the <i>Sea Rover</i>. The one
man yet unstricken is quite broken down with fright
and fatigue. The doctor says some one ought to go
there. What do you think?&#8217; And I said, &#8216;Minister,
do you mean me?&#8217; And he smiled a bit and answered,
&#8216;I thought you would know your duty, David.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why <i>your</i> duty, David? Surely Vala was
dearer and nearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The minister said, &#8216;You are a lone man, David,
and you fear God; so, then, you need not fear the
fever.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he knew that you hated Sinclair! Knew
that Sinclair had come to my house with the fever on
him&#8211;knew that he had lifted my poor bairn, only
that he might give her the death-kiss!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! How could any father, any man, be as
bad as that, Nanna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know not how bad the devil can make a man
when he enters into him. And how could the minister
send you such a hard road?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>&#8220;It was made easy to me; it was indeed, Nanna.
The sensible presence of God, and the shining of his
face on me, though only for a moment, made me willing
to give up all my anger and all my revenge, and
wait on my enemy, and do what I could for him to the
last moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Vala? How could you forget her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not forget her. I was feared for the child,
though I would not say that to you. Barbara told
me she had fret all night, and when I said it would be
for her mother, the woman shook her head in a way
that made me tremble. I was on my way to see her
and you when I met the minister, and he sent me the
other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you not tell him that you feared for
Vala?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said that, and he said, &#8216;Nanna will be able to
care for the little one; but there is a strong man
needed to care for her husband; Nicol Sinclair will be
hard to manage.&#8217; And then he minded me of the
man&#8217;s sinful life, and he said peradventure it might
be the purpose of God even yet to give him another
opportunity for repentance through me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If he had known Nicol Sinclair as I&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Nanna, but it is an awful thing to die eternally.
If I could help to save any one from such a
fate, even my worst enemy,&#8211;even your enemy and
Vala&#8217;s,&#8211;what should I have done? Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what you did. You have done right. Yes;
though the man killed Vala, you have done right!
You have done right!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew that would be your last word.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>&#8220;Did he have one good thought, one prayer, to
meet death with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did not. It was a wild night when he was in
the dead thraws&#8211;a wild night for the flitting; and he
went out in storm and darkness, and the sea carried
him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God have mercy upon him! I have not a tear
left for Nicol Sinclair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an awful death; but on the same night
there was a very good death after a very good life.
You have heard, Nanna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard nothing. For many days all has
been still and tidingless. The fever is in every house,
and no one comes near but the doctor, and he speaks
only to the sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, the good minister has gone home. He
was taken with the fever while giving the sacrament
to Elder Somerlid. And he knew that he would die,
for he said, &#8216;John Somerlid, we shall very soon drink
this cup together in the house of our Father in heaven.&#8217;
So when he got back to the manse he sent for Elder
Peterson, and gave him his last words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I know well that they would be good words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were like himself, full of hope. He spoke
about his books, and the money in his desk to pay all
his debts, and then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The days of my life are ended, but I have met the
hand of God, Peter, and it is strong to lead and to
comfort me. A word was brought to me even as I
held the blessed cup in my hand. Read to me from
the Book while I can listen to it.&#8217; And Peterson asked,
&#8216;What shall I read?&#8217; And the minister said, &#8216;Take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
the Psalms. There is everything in the Psalms.&#8217; So
Peterson read the ones he called for, and after a little
the minister said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That will do, Peter. I turn now from the sorrow
and pain and darkness of earth to the celestial city, to
infinite serenities, to love without limit, to perfect joy.
And when I am dead, see you to my burying, Peter.
Lay me in the grave with my face to the east, and put
above me Jesus Christ&#8217;s own watchword, &#8220;<i>Thy kingdom
come.</i>&#8221;&#8217; After that he asked only for water, and
so he died.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Blessed are such dead. There is no need to weep
for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is one thing sure; but I have seen this,
Nanna: that the wicked is unbefriended in his death-pang.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And after it, David? O David, after it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no darkness nor shadow of death where
the worker of iniquity may hide,&#8221; he answered with
an awful solemnity.</p>

<p>&#8220;O David, we come into the world weeping, and we
go out fearing. It is a hard travail, both for body
and soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>And David walked to the little table on which the
Book lay, and he turned the leaves until he found the
words he wanted. And Nanna watched him with
eyes purified by that mysterious withdrawal into the
life of the soul which comes through a great sorrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not always so, Nanna,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Listen!</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;For their sakes I made the world, and when Adam transgressed
my statutes, then was decreed that now is done.</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<div class='bquote'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>&#8220;Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, full of
sorrow and travail; they are but few and evil, full of perils and
very painful.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the entrances of the elder world were wide and sure,
and brought immortal fruit.</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>But yet there is to be a restoration, Nanna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not,&#8221; she answered wearily. &#8220;It is so far
off&#8211;so far away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is promised. It is sure.</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;The world shall be turned into the old silence seven days,
like as in former judgments, so that no man shall remain.</p>

<p>&#8220;And after seven days, the world, that yet awaketh not, shall
be raised up; and that shall die that is corrupt.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her; and
the dust, those that dwell in silence; and the secret places shall
deliver those souls that were committed unto them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the Most High shall appear upon the seat of judgment,
and misery shall pass away, and the long suffering shall have
an end.</p>

<p>&#8220;But judgment shall remain; truth shall stand; and faith
shall wax strong.&#8221;</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>&#8220;I know nothing of these things, David; I cannot
think of them. What I want is some word of comfort
about Vala&#8211;a little word from beyond would make
all the difference. <i>Why</i> is it not given? <i>Why</i> is
there no answering voice from the other side? There
is none on this. <i>Why</i> does God pursue a poor, broken-hearted
woman so hardly? Even now, when I have
wept my heart cold and dumb, I do not please him.
One thing only is sure&#8211;my misery. Oh, <i>why, why</i>,
David?&#8221;</p>

<p>And David could only drop his eyes before the sad,
inquiring gaze of Nanna&#8217;s. He murmured something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
about Adam and the cross, and told her sorrowfully
that He who hung upon it, forsaken, in the dark, also
asked, &#8220;Why?&#8221; The austerity and profound mystery
of his creed gave him no more comforting answer to
the pathetic inquiry.</p>

<p>He spent the day in the little hamlet, and, the
weather being dry and not very cold, he persuaded
Nanna to take a walk upon the cliff-top with him.
She agreed because she had not the strength to oppose
his desire; but if David had had any experience with
suffering women, he would have seen at once how ineffectual
his effort would be. The gray, icy, indifferent
sea had nothing hopeful to say to her. The gray
gulls, with their stern, cold eyes, watchful and hungry,
filled her ears with nothing but painful clamoring.
There was no voice in nature to cry, &#8220;Comfort,&#8221; to a
bruised soul.</p>

<p>She said the wind hurt her, that she was tired, that
she would rather sit still in the house and shut her
eyes and think of Vala. She leaned so heavily on
him that David was suddenly afraid, and he looked
with more scrutiny into her face. If his eyes had
been opened he would have seen over its youth and
beauty signs of a hand that writes but once; for when
despair assumes the dignity of patience it carries with
it the warrant of death.</p>

<p>They went slowly and silently back to the house,
and as they approached it David said, &#8220;Some one has
called, for the door is open.&#8221; And they walked a
little faster, so that Nanna&#8217;s cheeks flushed with the
movement and the wind.</p>

<p>Matilda Sabiston sat on the hearthstone grumbling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
at the cold, while the man-servant who had brought
her so far was piling the peats upon the fire to warm
her feet and hands. When David and Nanna entered
she did not move, but she turned her eyes upon them
with a malignant anger that roused in both a temper
very different from that in which their hopeless walk
had been taken. It was immediately noticeable in
Nanna. She dropped David&#8217;s hand and walked forward
to her visitor, and they looked steadily at each
other for a few moments. Then Matilda said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Think shame of yourself, to be so soon at the
courting again, and, above all, with him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nanna took no notice of the remark, but asked,
&#8220;Why are you here? I wish to have no dealings with
you, for no good can come of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would I come here for good? There is no good
in any of your kind. I came here to tell you that I
was glad that there is one Borson less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There has been death among your own kin, mistress,&#8221;
said David, &#8220;and such death as should make
the living fear to bring it to remembrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. You ought to fear. Did you slay
Nicol, as your father slew Bele Trenby, by water? or
did you poison him with drugs? or is your hand red
with his life-blood? And now, before the fish have
had time to pick his bones, you are wooing his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you let Nanna alone? She is ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ill? Babble! Look at her rosy cheeks! She
has been listening to your love-words. Who sent you
to the <i>Sea Rover</i>? What were you doing there? A
great plot! A wicked plot against poor Nicol!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I went to the <i>Sea Rover</i> because&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>&#8220;Very ready you were to go to Nicol&#8217;s ship and to
do your will there! Oh, it was a great opportunity!
None to see! none to tell tales! But I know you! I
know you! The black drop of murder is in every
Borson&#8217;s veins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistress, you are an old woman, and you may say
your say. If you were a man it would be different.
I would cut out your lying tongue, or make it eat its
own words.&#8221;</p>

<p>With railing and insolence she defied him to the act,
and David stood looking at her with his hands in his
pockets. As for Nanna, she had thrown off her cloak
and seated herself on Vala&#8217;s couch. She was trying
to control her temper; but the little room was already
impregnated with Matilda&#8217;s personality, and Nanna
could not escape from those indirect but powerful influences
that distil from an actively evil life.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish, Matilda Sabiston, that you would leave my
house,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think that you have brought the
devil in with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Matilda turned in her chair and looked at
Nanna. Her face, handsomely prominent in youth,
had become with sin and age like that of a bird of
prey; it was all nose and two fierce, gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you talk of the devil?&#8221; she screamed. &#8220;You,
who drove your husband to sin, and sent your baby
to hell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Nanna, with a pitiful cry, buried her face in
Vala&#8217;s pillow; and David, full of anger, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take you from this house, mistress. You were
not asked to come here, and you cannot stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will stay until I have said what you shall listen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
to. The child of this woman has been taken for your
father&#8217;s sin. The mother will go next. Then <i>you</i> will
bite the last morsel of Kol&#8217;s curse. I am living only
to see this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear not the curse of any man,&#8221; said David, in
a passion. &#8220;There is no power in any mortal&#8217;s curse
that prayer cannot wither. Keep it to yourself&#8211;you,
who believe in it. As for me&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As for you, I will give you some advice. When
the new minister is placed, go and tell him what Liot
Borson told you at his death-hour. For I know well
he did not die without boasting of his revenge on Bele
Trenby. Death couldn&#8217;t shut Liot&#8217;s mouth till the
words were out of it. Make the confession your father
ought to have made, and let me hear it. I have said
it, and fools have laughed at me, and wise men have
hid the words in their hearts; and I will not die till
my words are made true. And if you will not make
them true, then the dead will have their satisfaction, and
love will go to the grave and not to the bridal. Now,
then, do what is before you. I have set you your task.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with a rapid passion that would not be
interrupted, and then, still muttering threats and accusations,
tottered out of the cot on her servant&#8217;s arm.
David was speechless. The truth bound him. What
powers of divination this evil woman had, he knew
not, but she at least had driven home the unacknowledged
fear in his heart. He sat down by Nanna and
tried to comfort her, but she could not listen to him.
&#8220;Leave me alone to-day,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;I have had
all I can bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he went back to Lerwick, feeling with every step
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
he took that the task Matilda had set him would have
to be accomplished. The humiliation would indeed be
great, but if by confession he could ward off punishment
from Nanna he must accept the alternative.
Himself he took not into consideration. No threat
and no fear of personal suffering could have forced
him to speak; but if, peradventure, silence was sin,
and sin brought sorrow, then his duty to others
demanded from him the long-delayed acknowledgment.
However, he was not yet certain of the right,
and the new minister had not yet come, and there is
always some satisfaction in putting off what is dubious
and questionable.</p>

<p>The new minister was not finally settled until
Christmas. He proved to be a young man with the
air of theological schools still around him. David was
afraid of him. He thought of the tender, mellowed
temper of the old man whose place he was to fill, and
wished that his acknowledgment had been made while
he was alive. He feared to bring his father&#8217;s spiritual
case before one who had never known him, who had
grown up &#8220;southward&#8221; under very different influences,
who would likely be quite unable to go a step
beyond the letter of the law.</p>

<p>He talked to Nanna frequently about the matter,
and she was more than inclined to silence. &#8220;Let well
alone, David,&#8221; she said. &#8220;What good can come of
calling back old sins and sorrows? Who has set you
this task? One who has always hated you. If God
had sent, would he have sent by <i>her</i>? No; but when
the devil wants a cruel, wicked messenger, he can get
none so fit for his purpose as a bad old woman.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>However, while David hesitated Matilda went to the
new minister. She prefaced her story by a gift of ten
pounds for the replenishing of the manse, and then
told it according to her own wishes and imagination.</p>

<p>&#8220;The minister dead and gone would not listen to
me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He was a poor creature, and Liot
Borson was one of his pets. The man could do no
wrong in his eyes. So I have been sin-bearer for more
than twenty years. Now, then, I look to you to clear
this matter to the bottom, and let the talk about it
come to an end once for all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a grave matter,&#8221; said Minister Campbell, &#8220;and
I am astonished that my predecessor let it rest so long&#8211;though
doubtless he did it for the best, for there
will be two sides to this, as to all other disputes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is not,&#8221; answered Matilda, angrily. &#8220;All
is as I have told you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, according to your testimony, Liot Borson&#8217;s
guilt rests on your dreams. That is a poor foundation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always been a foresighted woman&#8211;a great
dreamer&#8211;and I dream true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I know not how to call a kirk meeting on a
dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was the Bible written for yesterday or for to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was written for every day, unto the end of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then look to it. Ask it how many of its great
events hang upon dreams. Take the dream life out
of the Bible, minister, and where are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistress Sabiston, I am not used to arguing with
women, but I will remind you that the dream life of
the Bible does not rest on female authority. It was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
the men of the Bible that saw visions and dreamed
dreams. As I remember, only one woman&#8211;a pagan,
Pilate&#8217;s wife&#8211;is recorded as being in this way instructed.
I should not be inclined to discipline the
memory of Liot Borson on the strength of your
dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is, or there was, other evidence; for much
of it has now gone away through the door of death.
What I want is Liot&#8217;s own confession. He made it to
his son before he gave up the ghost. Now, then, let
David speak for his father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a different thing. If David has a message
to deliver, he must deliver it, or he is recreant to his
trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;See to it, then. It is all I ask, but I have a right
to ask it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bele was my adopted son. I loved him. He was
my heir. I was a lone-living woman, and he was all
I had. As I have told you, Liot wished to marry my
niece Karen, that he might heir my property. He
had every reason to get Bele out of his way, and he
did it. Ask his son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words he became silent, and Matilda saw
that there was an end of the conversation for that
time. But she was now more eager and passionate
for the impeachment of Liot&#8217;s good name than she had
ever been, and she vowed to herself that if Minister
Campbell did not give her satisfaction he should have
all the petty misery and trouble her money and influence
could give him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>The young minister, however, did not hesitate. It
was a most unpleasant legacy to his charge, and he
was straitened until he had done his duty concerning
it. He went to see David at once, and heard from his
lips the whole truth. And he was greatly impressed
with the story, for the young man told it with such
truth and tenderness that every word went heartwise.
He could think of nothing better than to call a meeting
in the kirk, and summon David to tell the congregation
just what he had told him. And as it had been
Liot&#8217;s intention to do this very thing himself, the minister
could not see that David would be guilty of any
unkindness to his father&#8217;s memory. Quite the contrary.
He would be fulfilling his desire and doing for
him the duty he had been unable personally to perform.</p>

<p>David had nothing to say against the proposal. It
turned him faint, and he wondered if it would be possible
for him to stand up in the presence of his fellows,
and in the sight of all the women who admired
and respected him, and do what was required. A
cold sweat covered his face; his large hands felt
powerless; he looked at the minister appealingly, but
could not utter a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must speak for your father, David. Perhaps
you ought to have spoken before this. We can do so
little for the dead that any wish of theirs that is positive
ought to be sacredly granted. What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hard, minister. But what you say is right,
that I will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will not touch the Sabbath day, David. I
will ask the people to come to the kirk next Wednesday
afternoon. The men will not be at sea, and the
women will be at leisure then. What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>&#8220;As you think, minister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell them just what you have told me. I believe
every word you have said, and I will stand by you&#8211;I
and all good men and women, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, minister.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he could scarcely utter the words. He had
often thought of this ordeal; now that it was really
to face, his heart utterly failed him. He went straight
to Nanna, and she forgot her own sorrow in his, and
so comforted and strengthened him that he went away
feeling that all things would be possible if she was
always as kind and sympathetic.</p>

<p>It was then Friday, and Wednesday came inexorably
and swiftly. David tried in every way to prepare
himself, but no strength came from his efforts.
Prayer, nor meditation, nor long memories of the past,
nor hopes for the future, had any potency. He was
stupefied by the thing demanded of him, and the simple,
vivid cry which always brings help had not yet
been forced from his lips. But at the last moment it
came. Then the coldness and dumbness and wretched
inertness that had bound him, body and soul, were
gone. When he saw Matilda Sabiston enter the kirk,
her eyes gleaming and her face eager with evil expectations,
he felt the wondrous words of David<a id='FNanchor_3'></a><a href='#Footnote_3' class='fnanchor'><sup>[3]</sup></a> burning
in his heart and on his lips, and he was no longer
afraid. Psalm after psalm went singing through his
soul, and he said joyfully to himself, &#8220;Sometimes God
is long in coming, but he is <i>never too late</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>The minister did not ascend the pulpit. He stood
at the table, and after a prayer and a hymn he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We have come together this afternoon to hear
what David Borson has to say in regard to the charge
which Matilda Sabiston has made for twenty-six years
against his father Liot Borson.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That question was decided long ago,&#8221; said an old
man, rising slowly. &#8220;I heard Minister Ridlon give
verdict concerning it at the funeral of Liot&#8217;s wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was <i>not</i> decided,&#8221; cried Matilda, standing up,
and turning her face to the congregation. &#8220;Liot
Borson found it easy to lie at his wife&#8217;s coffin-side,
but when it came to his own death-hour he did not
dare to die without telling the truth. Ask his son
David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David Borson,&#8221; said the minister, &#8220;at your father&#8217;s
death-hour did he indeed confess to the slaying of Bele
Trenby?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David stood up. All fear had gone, he knew
not where. He looked even taller than his wont.
And the light of God&#8217;s presence was so close to him
that his large, fair face really had a kind of luminosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Minister,&#8221; he answered with a solemn confidence,
&#8220;minister and friends, my father at his death-hour
expressly said that <i>he did not slay Bele Trenby</i>. He
said that he laid no finger on him, that he fell into
his own snare. This is what happened: He met my
father on the moss, and said, &#8216;Good evening, Liot.&#8217;
And my father said, &#8216;It is dark,&#8217; and spoke no more.
You know&#8211;all of you know&#8211;they were ill friends
and rivals; so, then, silence was the best. And if
Bele had been content to be silent and tread slowly in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
my father&#8217;s steps he had reached his ship in safety.
But he must talk and he must hurry; and the first
was not wanted, and the second was dangerous. And
after a little my father&#8217;s shoe-strings came undone,
and he stooped to tie them&#8211;who wouldn&#8217;t, where a
false step or a fall might be death? And Bele went
on, and called back to him, &#8216;Is this the crossing?&#8217;
And father had not finished fastening his shoes, and
did not answer. So then Bele called again, and it is
likely father would not be hurried by him, and he did
not answer that time, either. And Bele said he was
in the devil&#8217;s temper, and went on at his own risk.
And the next moment there was a cry, and my father
lifted his head hastily, and the man had walked into
the moss, and then who <i>could</i> help him? But well I
know, if help had been possible, my father would have
given his own life to save life, even though the man
was ten times his enemy. Over and over I have seen
Liot Borson bring from the sea men who hated him,
and whom no one else would venture life for. Never
mortal man walked closer with God than Liot Borson.
I, who have lived alone with him for twenty years, I
know this; and I will dare to say that in the matter
of Bele Trenby he did no worse, and perhaps a great
deal better, than any other man would have done.
Why was Bele on the moss? He was a sailor and a
stranger. A man must have life-knowledge of the
moss to walk it in the night-time. When my father
was willing to guide him across it, was it too much
that he should be silent, and that he should let his
guide do a thing so necessary as to secure tightly his
shoes on the soft, unstable ground? Was his guide
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
to let go this safe precaution because Bele was in a
hurry to reach his ship? Was Liot Borson to blame
if the man&#8217;s foolhardiness and insolent presumption
led him into danger and death? As for me, I say this:
I wish to be a man after my father&#8217;s heart. For he
was a righteous man in all his ways, and kind-hearted
to every creature in trouble; and he was a life-saver,
and not a murderer. And this I, his loving son, will
maintain to my last breath. And if, after these words,
any man says, &#8216;Liot Borson was a murderer,&#8217; I will
call him a cowardly liar and slanderer at Lerwick
Market Cross, and follow the words to the end they
deserve. And God knows I speak the truth, and the
whole truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David sat down, and there was an audible stir
and movement of sympathy and approbation. And
the minister said: &#8220;I believe every word you have
spoken, David. If any present has a word to say,
now is the time to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Elder Hay rose and said: &#8220;Of what use is
talk? Liot Borson is dead and judged. How shall we,
sinful men ourselves, dare to meddle with the verdict
of the Lord God Almighty? If we in our ignorance
or spite reverse it, what a presumption it will be!
And if we confirm it, is God&#8217;s decree made stronger
by our &#8216;yea, yeas&#8217;? What at all does Mistress Sabiston
want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want Liot Borson&#8217;s name taken off the roll,&#8221; she
answered vehemently. &#8220;It has no right in the kirk&#8217;s
books. Cross it out! Blot it out! It is a shame to
the white pages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there here any man or woman who will do Mistress
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
Sabiston&#8217;s will, and cross out Liot Borson&#8217;s name
for her?&#8221; asked the minister.</p>

<p>There was a deep, emphatic &#8220;No!&#8221; And the minister
continued: &#8220;I would myself rather cut off my
right hand than cross out the name of one who has
passed far beyond our jurisdiction. Suppose&#8211;and
we have a right to suppose&#8211;that the name of Liot
Borson is written in the shining letters of the book of
life, and we have crossed it off our kirk book! What
then? I think this question is settled. I never want
to hear it named again. I will enter into no conversations
about it. It has been taken out of our hands
by God himself. We will not dare to discuss in any
way what he has already decided. We will now sing
together the Forty-third Psalm.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, amid the rustle of the opening leaves, the
minister himself started the psalmody. There was a
little air of hurry in his movements, as if he hasted to
drown all contention in singing; but he had reached
his usual grave composure before the end of the verses,
and the benediction fell like the final satisfying chords
of the melody.</p>

<p>Matilda was dumfounded by such a cutting short of
the case, but even she dared not interrupt functions
so holy as praise and prayer. In the kirk she was
compelled to restrain her indignation, but when she
found that the resolution of Minister Campbell not to
discuss the matter or enter into any conversation about
it was universally adopted by the townspeople, her
anger found words such as are not to be met with in
books; and she did not spare them.</p>

<p>David was singularly happy and satisfied. He had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
been grandly supported both by God and man, and he
was grateful for the pronounced kindness of his friends,
for their hand-shakings and greetings and loving words
and wishes. But when both the enthusiasm and the
pang of conflict were over, oh, how good it was to clasp
Nanna&#8217;s hand, and in this perfect but silent companionship
to walk home with her! Then Nanna made
a cup of tea, and they drank it together, and talked
over what had been said and done, finally drifting, as
they always did, to that invincible necessity that whatever
is could not but so have been. And though their
words were, as all human words about God must be,
terribly inadequate, yet their longing, their love, and
their fears were all understood. And He who is so
vast and strange when</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span><a id='link_9'></a>IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>A SACRIFICE ACCEPTED</span></h2>

<p>After this the winter came on rapidly
and severely. The seas were dangerous,
and the fishing precarious and
poor, and the fever still lingered, many
cases being found as far north as Yell.
Thus suffering and hard poverty and death filled the
short days and made twice as long the stretched-out
nights of the dark season. The old cloud gathered
round David, and when the minister preached of &#8220;the
will and purposes of God,&#8221; it seemed to David that
they were altogether penal. The unfathomable inner
side of his life was all gloom and doubt; how, then,
could the material side be cheerful and confident?</p>

<p>The new minister, however, had conceived a strong
liking for the young man; they were nearly of the
same age; and he saw that David was troubled about
spiritual matters, and took every opportunity to discuss
them with him. But he had too much of the
schools, he was too untried, and had been, in the main,
too happily situated to comprehend David&#8217;s views.
The very piety of the two men was different. David&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
was lively, personal, and tender; it sat in the center.
The minister&#8217;s was official, intellectually accepted,
conscientiously practised. It was not strange, then,
that any dissent David ventured to make was not
conceived of as a soul-query, but rather as a challenge
against impregnable truths. He was always ready to
defend Calvinism, though David did not consciously
attack it. To be sure, he said strange and daring
things&#8211;things which came from his heart, and which
often staggered his opponent; but all the more Minister
Campbell put on his armor to defend his creed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a hard religion for men and for women,&#8221; said
David, as they talked a stormy afternoon away on
Barbara&#8217;s hearthstone; &#8220;and why God gave it, I can&#8217;t
tell; for, after all, minister, the blessedness of heaven
is an eternity older than the damnation of hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men called it unto themselves, and it is not hard,
David. It is a grand creed; it is a strong anchor for
a weak soul; it won&#8217;t let a man drift into the deep
waters of infidelity or the miserable shoals of &#8216;perhaps&#8217;
and &#8216;suppose.&#8217; Neither will it let him float on
waves of feeling like Arminianism, and be content
with &#8216;ahs&#8217; and &#8216;ohs,&#8217; and shrink from &#8216;therefores.&#8217;
Calvinism makes strong men before the Lord, David,
and strong men are not laid on rose-leaves and fed on
pap and cream.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true, minister; for it seems to me that
whenever men are to be fishers, and fight the winds
and waves, or to make a living out of bare moor or
rocks, or to do any other of the hard work of life,
they are born Calvinists.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so, David. Arminians can weave a piece of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
broadcloth, and Episcopals can till the rich, juicy fields
of England; but God&#8217;s hard work&#8211;yes, David, and
his hard fighting&#8211;has to be done by his Calvinists.
They were the only fighting Protestants. But for
Calvinists, Puritans, Huguenots, there would have
been no Reformation. Philip and the Pope would
have had their way, and we should all have been
papists or atheists.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know not. You say so, minister, and it is doubtless
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true. You have been born to a noble creed;
accept it with thankfulness and without demur. You
are not called upon to understand it or to reason
about it. It is faith that conquers.&#8221;</p>

<p>And after such an oration the young minister would
go away with a proud sense of duty well performed,
burning with his own evangel, and liking David well
for being the invoker of his enthusiasm. But David,
after his departure, was always silent and depressed;
his intellect may have been quickened, but he was
not comforted.</p>

<p>The sunshine that had brightened his life during
the past year was gone, for he had found out that all
his happiness was bound up in Nanna, and Nanna was
on the verge of despair. Day by day she grew thinner
and whiter, more melancholy and more silent. She
did only work enough to supply the barest needs of
life, and for the most part sat hour after hour with
dropped hands and closed eyes; or she was seized with
a restlessness that drove her to motion, and then she
walked the small bounds of her room until physical
exhaustion threw her into deep sleep.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>David watched her with a sad patience. He had felt
severely the loss of Vala, and he did not presume to
measure Nanna&#8217;s sorrow by his own. He knew it was
natural that for some weeks she should weep for a
child so dear, whose little life had been so pitifully
wronged, so bound to suffering, so cruelly cut short.
But when this natural sorrow was not healed by time,
when Nanna nursed her grief to despair and dwelt
with it in the valley of the shadow of death, he
thought it time to reason with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will kill yourself, Nanna,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, David, I hate life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you wish to die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I am afraid to die. I know that I am sinning
every day in weeping for my poor lost bairn,
and yet I am that way made that I cannot help but
weep for her. For it is my fault, David, all my fault.
Why, then, did He pursue the child with His anger
from the first hour of her sorrowful life to the last?
And where is she now? O David, where is she? If
God would only let me go to her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Whist</i>, Nanna! You know not what you are saying.
You might be asking yourself away from His
presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would rather be with Vala. If that be sinful, let me
thole the wages of my sin. Where is my dear bairn?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard Elder Kennoch say we may have a hope
that God will eventually take pity on those babes who
have done no actual sin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>when</i> will he take pity? And until he does,
how can the wee souls endure his anger? O David,
my heart will break! My heart will break!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>&#8220;Nanna, listen to this: when Elga Wick&#8217;s child
died, the minister said there was a benign interpretation
of the doctrines which taught us that <i>none but
elect infants died</i>. It would be unjust, Nanna, unless
the child was elect, not to give it the offer of salvation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What good would eighty years of &#8216;offers&#8217; do, if
there was no election to eternal life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna, your father was a child of God, and you
have loved him from your youth upward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can that help Vala?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even so. He keeps his mercy for children&#8217;s children,
to the third and fourth generation of them that
fear him. Vala was in the direct succession of faith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know what her father and his folk have
been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why did my father let me marry the man?
He should rather have tied me hands and feet, and
cast me into the depths of the sea. He should have
said to me, &#8216;Nanna, you may have a bairn, and it may
be a child of sin, and thus foreordained to hell-fire.&#8217;
Do you think then I would have wed Nicol Sinclair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, I think you would.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe that I was born for that end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you had set your heart on Nicol at all
risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At that time Nicol was in good favor with all folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have told me that your father liked him not,
and that he said many things to you against a marriage
with him; so, then, if your heart had not been
fully set on its own way, his &#8216;no&#8217; would have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
sufficient. If we heed not fathers and mothers and
teachers, we should not heed, Nanna, no, not if one
came from the dead to warn us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is an awful truth, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And one must speak truth to heal a wounded soul.
If there be a canker in the body, you know well the
doctor must not spare the sharp knife. But I would
not put away hope for Vala&#8211;no, indeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, David? Oh, why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she not kindred in His presence? Will He
not remember His promise to them? Will they forget
to remind Him of it? I think not so hardly of
the dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David, I will tell you the last awful truth. I
never could get the poor little one baptized,&#8211;things
ay went so against it,&#8211;and she died without being
signed and sealed to His mercy; that is the dreadful
part of her death. I was ashamed&#8211;I was afraid to
tell you before. O David, if you had stayed by Vala
instead of going to that man, you might perhaps have
won her this saving grace; but it was not to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>David almost fainted with the shock of this intelligence.
He understood now the anguish which was
driving Nanna into the grave; and he had no comfort
to offer her, for Nanna seemed to make out a terribly
clear case of rejection and of foreordained refusal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was feared to ask Nicol to stand with the child
when it ought to have been presented in the kirk,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;But your father?&#8221; asked David.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was feared to ask my father to stand in Nicol&#8217;s
place, lest it should make Nicol harder to me than he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
was. And,&#8221; she continued, weeping bitterly as she
spoke, &#8220;I thought not of Vala dying, and hoped that
in the future there might be a way opened. If father
had lived he would have seen to the child&#8217;s right, but
he was taken just when he was moving in the matter;
and then Nicol grew harder and harder, and as for
the kirk, he would not go there at all, and I had no
kin left to take his place. Then the child was hurt,
and I was long ill, and Nicol went away, and my
friends grew cold, fearing lest I might want a little
help, and even the minister was shy and far off. So
I came out here with my sorrow, and waited and
watched for some friend or some opportunity. &#8216;To-morrow,
perhaps to-morrow,&#8217; I said; but it was not
to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna, you should have told me this before. I
would have made the promises for Vala; I would have
done so gladly. Surely you should have spoken to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every day I thought about it, and then I was
feared for what would happen when Nicol found it out.
And do you not think that Matilda Sabiston would
have sent him word that I had set you to do his duty?
She would have twitted him about it until he would
have raged like a roaring lion, and blackened my good
name, and yours also, and most likely made it a cause
for the knife he was ever so ready to use. And then,
David, there are folks&#8211;kirk folks, and plenty of them&#8211;who
would have said, &#8216;There must be something
wrong to set Nicol Sinclair to blood-spilling.&#8217; And
Matilda Sabiston would have spoken out plainly and
said, &#8216;There is something wrong&#8217;&#8211;and this and that,
and more to it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>&#8220;And well, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, being Matilda, no one would have
thought of contradicting her; for she gives much
money to the kirk and the societies, and has left all
she has to free slaves. No; there was nothing to be
done but to thole and be quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There might be some excuse for being quiet when
Vala was not in danger, but when her life was going,
why did you not send for the minister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what happened; for, David, God&#8217;s will
must be done. No one came here but the doctor. On
the second day he said, &#8216;She is not very sick.&#8217; At
his next visit he said, &#8216;She will die.&#8217; Then I told him
the child was not baptized, and prayed him to go for
the minister. And he said he would certainly do so.
But he was called here and there, and he forgot that
day; and the next morning very early he went to the
manse, and the minister had gone away; and the great
storm kept him away for three days; so when he got
back the message had been overlaid by many others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Nanna! Nanna!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was so. After the storm the doctor came
again, and Vala was dying. And then he rode like a
man riding for his life, and spoke very angrily to the
minister, who was not to blame at all, and the minister
was hurt at his words; but he came that afternoon,
and it was <i>too late</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Nanna! O Vala! Vala! Vala!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the minister was angry with me for my delays,
and he spoke the hard truth to me, and every word
went to my soul like a sword. I thought I should die
that night, and I longed to die. There was no friend
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
to say to me one word of comfort, and I did not dare
to pray. I was feared God would ask me, &#8216;Where is
your child?&#8217; O David, what for at all did God make
us? For this life is full of sorrow, and it is little comfort
to be told that there is a worse one after it.&#8221;</p>

<p>David took her hand, and a tear dropped upon her
slender brown fingers; but he did not answer her
question. Indeed, he could not. The same bewildering
inquiry had haunted his own sad life. So much
sorrow and pain, and at the end perhaps to be &#8220;hardly
saved,&#8221; while all around innumerable souls were going
down, without hope or helper, to eternal wrath!
What for at all had God made man for such a
fate?</p>

<p>For that he had <i>not</i> made man for such ends was a
fact outside their understandings, even as a possibility;
and its very suggestion at this hour would have appeared
to both an impiety of the worst kind. So they
consoled each other in the only way possible to souls
at once so miserable and so submissive. With clasped
hands they wept together over the inscrutable fate
which had set them so hard a lesson to learn as life,
with so little light to learn it by.</p>

<p>Natural events deepened the gloom of this spiritual
thraldom. Storms of unusual severity swept over the
bare, brown land, and the fishing was not only dangerous,
but often impossible. But David regarded
frost and snow, stormy winds and raging seas, poverty,
pestilence, and death, as part of the eternal necessity
pursuing its never-ending work through discord and
imperfection. When there was a possibility of casting
the fifty fathoms of ling-lines, David and his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
helpers were sure to venture out; when it was clearly
impossible, he went to Nanna&#8217;s and sat with her.</p>

<p>To the ordinary observer there did not seem to be
pleasure enough in these visits to reward him for the
stormy walk over the moor. His clothing was often
wet or stiff with frost, or he was breathless with fighting
the strong wind, and not infrequently he lost
himself in the bewildering snow; but with some trifle
in his pocket for Nanna, he always managed to reach
her. It might be only a fish, or a loaf of bread which
Barbara had baked for her, or a little fresh milk in a
bottle; but it was an offering made rich by that true
affection which counted weariness rest for her sake.</p>

<p>He generally found her sitting brooding by her peat
fire. Now, peat is cheap in Shetland, and Nanna had
no stint of the fuel, but it does not make a cheerful
fire. Its want of flame and its dull-red glow stimulate
sorrowful musing; and as there is little radiation of
heat from it, those whom it warms must sit close to
its embers. Thus David and Nanna passed many
hours of that sad winter. The snow often veiled what
light of day there was, and the great sea-winds shrieked
around the hut and blew the peat smoke down the
chimney into their faces; and there was little warmth
or comfort, and none of the pretty accessories that
love generally delights in.</p>

<p>But David&#8217;s love was not dependent upon accidentals.
He had seen Nanna when he thought her very
finely dressed; he had watched her when she was
happy with her child and contented with his friendship;
but she was not then more beautiful than she
was now, when her eyes were haunted by despairing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
thoughts, and her face white and sad, and her noble
form was shrouded rather than dressed in the black
gown of her loss and woe.</p>

<p>To David she was ever Nanna. It was the woman
beneath the outward form he desired&#8211;the woman
whose tears and fears and wounded love were part
of his own sufferings, whose despair was his despair,
whose personality, even, affected something far deeper
and chaster than that physical emotion too often misnamed
love. He knew that he could live for her,
however sorrowful life might be; he knew that he
could gladly die for her, if his death could bring her
spiritual peace or hope.</p>

<p>Thus, in the red light of the glowing peats, with the
stormy world around them, to David and Nanna the
winter months wore away. When Nanna was able to
weep she was then at her best&#8211;the most companionable,
the most grateful, and the most affectionate.
And few would think such circumstances favorable
to the growth of love; but that is a great mistake.
Love is not perfect love until it has been watered
again and again with tears.</p>

<p>Of the growth of this affection it is not likely either
was quite unaware; but there is an instinctive dislike
in a pure heart to investigate the beginnings of love.
It is like laying bare the roots of a flower to see
how it grows. And in Nanna&#8217;s case there was even a
fear of such a condition. Love had brought her only
heartbreak and despair. Without deliberate intention,
she yet grew a little more shy of David; she began to
restrain spiritual confidence and to weep alone. He
was not slow to feel the change, and it depressed him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
and made Barbara wonder at Nanna&#8217;s ingratitude and
womanish unreason.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good man fretting for her love, when there are
hearts and hearts full waiting for his asking,&#8221; she said
to her neighbor Sally Groat.</p>

<p>And Sally answered: &#8220;Well, well, there is a fool in
every one&#8217;s sleeve sometimes; and David Borson is
that daft about blood-kin, there is no talking to him.
But this is what I say: for all your kindred, make
much of your friends&#8211;and a friend you have been to
him, Barbara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I have done my best; and friends are
to be taken with their faults. To-day I shall talk to
David; for the spring comes on so quickly, and I heard
that my son&#8217;s ship had been spoke in the Iceland seas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is long now since Nanna&#8217;s baby died, and she
still weeps without end for her. She ought to try and
forget. It was but a sickly child, and never like to be
world-wise or world-useful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say such words, Sally,&#8221; answered Barbara,
with some warmth. &#8220;No one can tell a mother,
&#8216;Thy heart shall not remember.&#8217; I have laid in earth
five children, and do you think I ever slunk away
from heartache by forgetting them? No, indeed! I
would have counted <i>that</i> treason against my own soul.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s blessing! there is none wants to contradict
you, Barbara. Don&#8217;t be so hasty, woman. But you
know there has been death and weeping in many
houses besides Nanna&#8217;s this winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; acknowledged Barbara. &#8220;Death has
asked no man&#8217;s leave to enter; he has gone into the
rich man&#8217;s house as well as into poor Nanna&#8217;s hut.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>&#8220;Every door is wide enough for a coffin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and the minister said last Sabbath that it
was this which dissatisfied us with these habitations
of clay, and made us lift our eyes to those eternal in
the heavens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, to come back to David,&#8221; said Sally,
&#8220;he is good, and able to marry. He has saved money,
no doubt. Some young men spend their last bawbee,
and just live between ebb and flow. That isn&#8217;t David
Borson. Besides, Barbara, you ought to tell him how
people are talking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may do that. David is imprudent, and Nanna
is too miserable to care. Well, then, those who kindle
the fire must put up with the smoke; yet, for all
that, I shall have a word or two for him, and that very
soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>David had been at sea all night, and while this conversation
was going on he was sleeping; but in the
afternoon, as Barbara saw him preparing to go to
Nanna&#8217;s, she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stay a minute, David Borson. I want to speak to
you. I had good news early this morning. My son&#8217;s
ship was met not so far away, and he may get home
at any time, and me not thinking of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to hear it, Barbara. Then, also, you
will want my room. I must look for a new place, and
that is bad for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking of Nanna Sinclair,&#8221; said Barbara,
in a musing manner. &#8220;People do talk about you and
her. I have heard say&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I have heard say&#8217; is half a lie,&#8221; answered David.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that too; but Nanna&#8217;s good name is to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
thought of, and a man does not go every day to see a
woman for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David leaped to his feet with a face like a
flame. &#8220;The shortest and best answer is doing the
thing,&#8221; he muttered; and he walked straight to
Nanna&#8217;s house, telling himself as he went, &#8220;I have
been too long about it; I must speak now, and she
must answer me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was in his fishing-garb, for he intended going
to sea with the tide then rising; but he thought no
more of dressing for the interview than he thought of
preparing his speeches. Hitherto he had in a manner
drifted with the current of his great affection, never
consciously asking himself where it was bearing him;
but if people were talking about Nanna, then he must
take away all occasion for suspicion&#8211;he must at once
ask Nanna to be his wife. And as soon as he took the
first step toward her he felt how close and dear she
had become to him. He knew then that if Nanna was
lost all the world would be nothing. She had grown
into his life as the sea and the stars had grown, and
he shrank from any thought that could imply separation.
He walked with rapid steps across the moor,
feeling dimly the beauty of the spring afternoon, with
its haze of gold and purple on the horizon, where the
gray clouds opened out in wistful stretches of daffodil
skies.</p>

<p>The door of Nanna&#8217;s house stood open, and the
wind, full of the sharp salt savor of the sea, blew life
into the little room. Nanna was busy with her knitting,
and the soft, lace-like shawl lay upon her knee.
David shut the door and went to her side. His heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
was too full to hesitate or to choose words; the simplest
were the best.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna, I have found out that I love you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Nanna, dearest woman, do you hear me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then her cheeks burned rosy, and she looked at
David, and her hands trembled, and the work fell from
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Love me a little, my dear! Love me, Nanna!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do love you, David. Who in all the world have
I but you?&#8221; And the beautiful woman stood up, and
he took her within his arms and kissed her.</p>

<p>For a moment or two David was happy. His large,
fair face shone; he laughed softly as he drew Nanna
to his breast. He was really as intoxicated with joy
as some men are with wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will be married next week, Nanna,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;this week&#8211;to-morrow, if you will. It has come to
this: I must leave Barbara, and there is a house empty
close to the quay, and it shall be our home, Nanna;
for I have sixty pounds, my dear woman, and at last,
at last&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Before he reached this point he was sensible of
some chill or dissent, but he was not prepared for
Nanna&#8217;s answer:</p>

<p>&#8220;David, why do you talk of marrying? It is ever
that. I will not marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, Nanna? Is it too soon? But why for a
dead man will you keep me waiting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not of any dead man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it Vala? Vala would rejoice in our happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not marry&#8211;no, not any man living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you say that you loved me?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>&#8220;I do love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you do not.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put her gently away from him, and looked at her
with a somber sternness. &#8220;You do not love me,&#8221; he
continued. &#8220;If you did, you would put me first; you
would say, &#8216;I will be your wife.&#8217; You would delight
to make me happy&#8211;I, who have never been happy but
in sharing your joys and sorrows.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O David, I do love you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then be my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot! I cannot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you love me as light, vain women love: to
make slaves of men, and bring them back and back to
be hurt. It is not to be so with me. No, indeed!
Farewell, Nanna.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice failed him. He turned toward the door,
and for a moment Nanna could not realize that he was
actually bidding her a final farewell. When she did
she flew to his side, and arrested his hand as he was
opening the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come back! Come back, David!&#8221; she entreated.
&#8220;You are all wrong; you are very cruel to me. If
you leave me it will break my heart! It will be the
last blow, David. It is the very truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated enough to make Nanna weep with
passionate distress, and this emotion he was not able
to bear. He took her within his arm again, led her to
a chair, and sat down at her side, and as he kissed the
tears from her face said:</p>

<p>&#8220;If indeed you do love me, Nanna&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>If</i> I do love you!&#8221; she interrupted. &#8220;I love none
but you. You are heart of my heart and soul of my
soul. I hear you coming when you are half a mile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
away. I have no joy but when you are beside me. I
shall die of grief if you leave me in anger. I would
count it heaven and earth to be your wife, but I dare
not! I dare not!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was sobbing piteously when she ended this protestation,
and David comforted her with caresses and
tender words. &#8220;What fears you, Nanna?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Oh, my dear, what fears you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what I fear,&#8221; she answered, freeing herself
from his embrace, and looking steadily at him. &#8220;This
is what I fear, David. If we were married I might
have another child&#8211;I might have many children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he clasped her hand tightly, for he began to
see where Nanna was leading him, as she continued
with slow solemnity:</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you, can the minister, can any human being,
give me assurance they will be elect children? If
you can, I will be your wife to-morrow. If you cannot,
as the God of my father lives, I will not bring
sons and daughters into life for sin and sorrow here,
and for perdition hereafter. The devil shall not so use
my body! To people hell? No; I will not&#8211;not even
for your love, David!&#8221;</p>

<p>Her words, so passionate and positive, moved him
deeply. He was the old David again&#8211;the light, the
gladness, all but the tender, mournful love of the past,
gone from his face. He held both her hands, and he
looked down at them lying in his own as he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of us are His children, Nanna. We are His
by generations and by covenant. He has promised
mercy to such. Well, then, we may have a reasonable
hope&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope! No, no, David! I must have something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
better than hope. I hoped for Vala, and my hope has
been my hell. And as for the child&#8211;my God! where
is the child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We love God, Nanna, and the children of the
righteous&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are no safer than the children of the wicked,
David. I have thought of this continually. There
was John Beaton&#8217;s son; he killed a man, and died on
the gallows-tree, to the shame and the heartbreak of
his good father and mother. The lad had been baptized,
too,&#8211;given to God when he drew his first breath,&#8211;and
God must have rejected him. Minister Stuart&#8217;s
son forged a note, and was sent with felons across the
sea. His father and mother had prayed for him all
the days of his life; he was brought to the kirk and
given to God in baptism; and God must have rejected
him also. Think of good Stephen and Anna Blair&#8217;s
children. Their daughter&#8217;s name cannot be spoken
any more, and their sons are bringing down their
gray hairs with sorrow to the grave&#8211;with sorrow and
shame too. Go through the whole kirk, the whole
town, the islands themselves, and you will be forced
to say, David, that it is the children of the righteous
that go to the devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna! Nanna!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the truth, David. How the good God can
treat his bairns so, I know not; but you and I may
also deserve his wrath in like manner. I am feared
to hope different. O David, I am feared to be a
mother again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna! Nanna! what can I say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to say. If I should meet Vala
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
in that place where infants &#8216;earnestly desire to see and
love God, and yet are not able to do so,&#8217; I should cover
my face before the child. If she blamed me, I should
shiver in speechless agony; if she did not blame me,
it would be still harder to bear. Were we only sure&#8211;but
we are not sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>We are not sure.</i>&#8221; David repeated the words with
a sad significance. Nanna&#8217;s argument, evolved from
her own misery and illustrated by that misery, had
been before David&#8217;s eyes for months. He could not
escape from such reasoning and from such proof,
and his whole life, education, and experience went to
enforce the pitiful dilemma in which their love had
placed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is His will, and we must bear it to the uttermost,&#8221;
continued Nanna, with a sorrowful resignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very wretched, Nanna.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I, David, very wretched indeed. I used to
think monks and nuns, and such as made a merit of
not marrying, were all wrong; maybe they are nearer
right than we think for. Doubtless they have a tender
conscience toward God, and a tender conscience is what
he loves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David rose from Nanna&#8217;s side and walked
rapidly to and fro in the room. Motion helped him
to no solution of the tremendous difficulty. And
Nanna&#8217;s patient face, her fixed outward gaze, the
spiritual light of resolute decision in her eyes, gave to
her appearance an austere beauty that made him feel
as if this offering up of their love and all its earthly
sweetness was a sacrifice already tied to the horns of
the altar, and fully accepted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>Now, the law of duty lay very close to David&#8217;s
thoughts; it was an ever-present consciousness, haunting
his very being; but the sensual nature always
shrinks away from it. David sat down and covered
his face with his hands, and began to weep&#8211;to sob as
strong men sob when their sorrow is greater than they
can bear; as they never sob until the last drop, the
bitterest drop of all, is added&#8211;the belief that God
has forsaken them. This was the agony which tore
David&#8217;s great, fond heart in two. It forced from him
the first pitiful words of reproach against his God:</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sure at last that I was going to be happy,
and God is not willing. From my youth up he has
ay laid upon me the rod of correction. I wish that
I had never been born!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor lad! but you are not meaning it.&#8221; And
Nanna put her arms around his neck and wept with
him. For some minutes he let her do so, for he was
comforted by her sympathy; but at last he stood up,
passed his hand across his eyes, and said as bravely
as he could:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Nanna. If you feel in this way, I
dare not force your conscience. But I must go away
until I get over the sore disappointment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where will you go to, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can tell? The countries in which I may
have to earn and eat my bread I know not. But if I
was seeing you every day, I might get to feel hard at
God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! He fashioned us, David, and he knows
what falls and sore hurts we must get before we learn
to step sure and safe.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>&#8220;In the end it may all be right. I know not. But
this I know: pain and cold and hunger and weariness
and loneliness I have borne with a prayer and a tight
mouth, and I have never said before that I thought
him cruel hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His ways are not cruel, my dear love; they are
only past our finding out. The eternal which makes
for righteousness cannot be cruel. And if we could
see God with our eyes, and hear him with our ears,
and understand him with our reason, what grace
would there be in believing in him? Did not the
minister say last Sabbath that our life was hid with
Christ in God, and that therefore God must first be
pierced ere we could be hurt or prejudiced? Then
let us take what comfort we can in each other&#8217;s affection,
David, and just try and believe that God&#8217;s ways
are the very best of all ways for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometime&#8211;perhaps&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t leave me, David. I can bear all things
if you are near to help and comfort me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay; but women are different. I cannot fight
the temptation when I am in it; I must run away
from it. Farewell! Oh, dear, dear Nanna, farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed the words upon her lips, and went hastily
out of the house; but when he had walked about one
hundred yards he returned. Nanna had thrown herself
despairingly upon the rude couch made for Vala,
and on which the child had spent most of her life.
There Nanna lay like one dead. David knelt down by
her; he took her within his arms, kissed her closed
eyes, and murmured again upon her lips his last words
of love and sorrow. Her patient acceptance of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
hard lot made him quiver with pain, but he knew well
that for a time, at least, they must each bear their grief
alone.</p>

<p>Nanna&#8217;s confession of her love for him had made
everything different. In her presence now he had not
the power to control his longing for reciprocal affection.
He felt already a blind resentment and rebellion
against fate&#8211;a sense of wrong, which it was hard to
submit to. But how could he fight circumstances
whose foundations were in eternity? At this hour, at
least, he had come to the limit of his reason and his
endurance. Again and again he kissed Nanna farewell,
and it was like tearing his life asunder when he
put away her clinging arms and left her alone with
the terrible problem that separated their lives.</p>

<p>There is something worse than the pang of keenest
suffering&#8211;the passive state of a subjugated heart. A
dismal, sullen stillness succeeded to David&#8217;s angry
sorrow. He avoided Barbara and shut himself in his
room. And his strong and awful prepossession in
favor of the Bible led him, first of all, to go to the
book. But he found no help there. His soul was
tossed from top to bottom, and he was vanquished by
the war in his own bosom. For in our wrestling alone
angels do not always come. And David brought his
dogmas over and over to the Scriptures, and was
crushed spiritually between them, so that at last, worn
out with the mental and heart struggle, he submitted
to the fatality he could not alter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go the right road,&#8221; he said, &#8220;however cruel
that road may be. Then death may give me back to
God a miserable man, but not a guilty one.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>And he did not comprehend that, in thus preferring
an unseen duty because it was right to a seen pleasure
because it was pleasant, he was consummating that
sublime act of faith whose cry of victory is, &#8220;Thy
will be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nanna did not suffer so much. In the first place,
the pale, sad, almost despairing woman was glad and
dared, in her despair, because the man she loved
durst not sin, even for her. In the second, her battle
was practically over. She had been in the van of it
for months, and had come gradually to that state of
submission which fears to resist, lest resistance might
be found to be fighting against God. While David
was yet in an agony of struggle with his love and his
desires, his tender conscience and his dread of offending
the Deity, Nanna had washed away her tears, and
was strengthening her heart by saying continually, as
the glancing needles glided to and fro:</p>

<table summary='poetry' class='poetry'><tr><td>
<p>My God and Father, while I stray</p>
<p>Far from my home, on life&#8217;s rough way,</p>
<p>Oh, teach me from my heart to say,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Thy will be done!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>For some dauntless, primitive confidence in the love
of the Maker of men is older than any creed. And
there were yet hours when Nanna&#8217;s soul outleaped its
mortal shadow and had mystic flashes, native and
sweet, beyond the reach of will and endeavor&#8211;intimations
of serenities and compensations which would be
neither small nor long delayed.</p>

<p>Holding despair at bay, David quickly
made his preparations for an extended
absence. He hired his boat and lines to
Groat&#8217;s sons, and on the morning of the
second day, after bidding Nanna farewell,
he went to Minister Campbell&#8217;s to complete his
arrangements. The minister was writing his sermon,
and he was not pleased at the interruption; but when
he saw David&#8217;s face, the shadow of annoyance on his
own passed away like a thought. He dropped his
pen, and turned in his chair so as to see the young
man fairly, and then he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is wrong, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am all at sea, minister, drifting&#8211;drifting&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your anchor, David? Can&#8217;t you steady
yourself on God? Can&#8217;t you make harbor someway?&#8221;</p>

<p>David shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then up sail and out to sea, and face the storm.
What quarter is it from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It comes from a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, David, that is bad to buffet. I have been
through it. It was that storm which brought me here.
I know all about it.&#8221;</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

GROAT.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>&#8220;Please, minister, I think not. It is Nanna Sinclair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so. You love her, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better than my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And she does not love you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She loves me as I love her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what is there to make you miserable? In a
few months, David, you will marry her and be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna will not marry me in a few months&#8211;she
will not marry me at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna ought not to trouble a good man with such
threats. Of course she will marry. Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David told the minister &#8220;why not.&#8221; He listened
at first with incredulity, and then with anger.
&#8220;Nanna Sinclair is guilty of great presumption,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;Why should she sift God&#8217;s ordination
and call in question results she is not able to understand?
Marriage is in the direct command of God,
and good men and women innumerable have obeyed
the command without disputing. It is Nanna&#8217;s place
to take gratefully the love God has sent her&#8211;to obey,
and not to argue. Obedience is the first round of the
ascending ladder, David; and when any one casts it
off, he makes even the commencement of spiritual life
impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke rapidly, and more as if he was trying to
convince himself than to console David. His words,
in any case, made no impression. David listened in
his shy, sensitive, uncomplaining way, but the minister
was quite aware he had touched only the outermost
edge of feeling. David&#8217;s eyes, usually mild and large,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
had now his soul at their window. It was not always
there, but when present it infected and went through
those upon whom it looked. The minister could not
bear the glance. He rose, and gently pushed David
into a chair, and laid his hands on his shoulders, and
looked steadily at him. He could see that a gap had
been made in his life, and that the bright, strong man
had emerged from it withered and stricken. He sat
down by his side and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Talk, David. Tell me all.&#8221;</p>

<p>And David told him all, and the two men wept together.
Yet, though much that David said went like
a two-edged sword through the minister&#8217;s convictions,
he resented the thrust, and held on to his stern plan
of sin and retribution like grim death, all the more so
because he felt it to be unconsciously attacked. And
when David said: &#8220;It is the Shorter Catechism, minister;
it is a hard book for women and bairns, and I
wonder why they don&#8217;t teach them from the Scriptures,
which are easy and full of grace,&#8221; the answer came with
a passionate fervor that was the protest for much besides
the catechism.</p>

<p>&#8220;David! David! You must say nothing against the
Shorter Catechism. It is the Magna Charta of Calvinism,
and woe worth the day for dear old Scotland
when its silver trumpet shall no longer be heard
and listened to. Its rules and bonds and externals
are all very necessary. Believe me, David, few men
would remain religious without rules and bonds and
externals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am, as I said, minister, all at sea. I find nothing
within my soul, nothing within my life-experience,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
to give me any hope, and I am going away a miserable
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David, your hope is not to be grounded on anything
within yourself or your life-experience. When
you wish to steady your boat, do you fix your anchor
on anything within it, or do you cast your anchor
outside?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cast it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the soul must cast out its anchor, and lay hold,
not on anything within itself, but on the hope set before
it. The anchor of your boat often drags, David,
and you drift in spite of it, for there is no sure bottom;
but the soul that anchors on the truth of God, the
immutability of his counsels, the faithfulness of his
promises, is surely steadfast. For I will tell you a
great thing, David: God has given us this double
guaranty&#8211;he has not only said, but sworn it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus the two men talked the morning away. Then
David remembered that he had come specially to ask
the minister to write out his will and take charge of
the money he would leave behind and the rents accruing
from the hire of his boat and lines. There was
nothing unusual in this request. Minister Campbell
had already learned how averse Shetlanders are to
having dealings with a lawyer, and he was quite willing
to take the charge David desired to impose upon
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may not come back to Shetland,&#8221; David said.
&#8220;My father went away and never returned. I am
bound for foreign seas, and I may go down any day
or night. All I have is Nanna&#8217;s. If she is sick or in
trouble, you will see to her relief, minister. And if I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
come not back in five years, sell the boat and lines and
make over all to Nanna Sinclair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a writing was drawn up to this effect; and
David brushed the tears from his eyes with his right
hand, and put it, wet with them, into the minister&#8217;s.
He had nothing more to say with his lips, but oh, how
eloquent were his great, sad, imploring eyes! They
went together to the manse door, and then the minister
followed him to the gate of the small croft. And
as they stood, one on either side of it, David murmured:</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, minister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, David, and see that you don&#8217;t think hardly
of either your God or your creed. Your God will be
your guide, even unto death; and as for your creed,
whatever faults men may find in it, this thing is sure:
Calvinism is the highest form ever yet assumed by the
moral life of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next morning, in the cold white light of the
early dawn, David left Lerwick. The blue moon was
low in the west, the mystery and majesty of earth all
around him. At this hour the sea was dark and quiet,
the birds being still asleep upon their rocky perches,
and the only noise was the flapping of the sails, and
the water purring softly with little treble sounds
among the clincher chains and against the sides of the
boat. David was a passenger on the mail-boat. He
had often seen her at a distance, but now, being on
board, he looked her over with great interest. She
seemed to be nearly as broad as she was long, very
bluff at the bows, and so strongly built that he involuntarily
asked the man at the wheel: &#8220;What kind
of seas at all is this boat built for?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s built for the Pentland Firth seas, my lad,
<i>weather permitting</i>. And there&#8217;s no place on God&#8217;s
land or water where them two words mean so much;
for I can tell you, weather <i>not</i> permitting, even this
boat couldn&#8217;t live in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gradually David made his way to Glasgow, and
from Glasgow to London. Queen Victoria had then
just been crowned, and one day David saw her out driving.
The royal carriage, with its milk-white horses,
its splendid outriders and appointments, and its military
escort, made a great impression on him, but the
fair, girlish face of the young, radiant queen he never
forgot. Hitherto kings and queens had been only a
part of his Bible history; he had not realized their
relation to his own life. Shetland was so far from
London that newspapers seldom reached Lerwick.
Politics were no factor in its social or religious life.
The civil lords came to try criminal cases, but the
minister was the abiding power. Until David saw
the young queen he had not heard of her accession
to the throne, but with the first knowledge of her
&#8220;right&#8221; there sprang up in his heart the loyalty she
claimed. Had any one asked him in that hour to enter
her service, he would have stepped on board her
war-ships with the utmost enthusiasm.</p>

<p>But nobody did ask him, and he found more commonplace
employment on the <i>Elizabeth</i>, a trig, well-built
schooner, trading to the Mediterranean for fruits
and other products of the Orient. The position was
the very one his father had so earnestly desired.
Touching first at one historic city and then at another,
living in the sunshine, and seeing the most picturesque
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
side of civilization, David added continually to the store
of those impressions which go to make up the best part
of life.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Elizabeth</i> owned the vessel and
was very fond of her; consequently he was not long
in finding out the splendid sea qualities of the young
Shetlander. On the fourth voyage he made David his
mate, and together they managed the <i>Elizabeth</i> so
cleverly that she became famous for her speed and
good fortune. It was indeed wonderful to see what
consciousness and sympathy they endowed her with.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Elizabeth</i> is behaving well,&#8221; the captain said one
morning, as he watched her swelling canvas and noted
her speed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much sea on,&#8221; answered David; &#8220;hardly
more than what we used to call in Shetland &#8216;a northerly
lipper.&#8217; But yet I don&#8217;t like the look to the east&#8217;ard
and the nor&#8217;ard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I. You had better tell <i>Elizabeth</i>. Talk to her,
David; coax her to hurry and get out of the bay.
Promise her a new coat of paint; say that I think of
having her figurehead gilded.&#8221;</p>

<p>David was used to hearing <i>Elizabeth</i> treated as if
she were a living, reasonable creature, but he always
smiled kindly at the imputation; it touched something
kindred in his own heart, and he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll do her best if she&#8217;s well handled. It&#8217;s her
life as well as ours, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is; anybody knows that. If you ever went into
shipping and insurance offices, David, you would hear
even landsmen say so. They make all their calculations
on the average <i>life</i> of a ship. My lad, men build
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
her of wood and iron, but there is something more in
a good ship than wood and iron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look to the east, captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there was the boatswain&#8217;s whistle, and the
shout of sailormen, and the taking in of sails, and that
hurrying and scurrying to make a ship trig which
precedes the certain coming of a great storm. And
the Bay of Biscay is bad quarters in any weather, but
in a storm it defies adequate description. When the
wind has an iron ring and calls like a banshee, and the
waves rise to its order as high as the masthead, then
God help the men and ships on the Bay of Biscay!</p>

<p>Five days after the breaking of this storm the <i>Elizabeth</i>
was sorely in need of such potential help. Her
masts were gone, the waves were doubling over her,
and her plunges were like the dive of a whale. At the
wheel there was a man lashed,&#8211;for the hull was seldom
above water,&#8211;and this man was David Borson. He
was the only sailor left strong enough for the work,
and he was at the last point of endurance. The icy
gusts roared past him; the spray was like flying whiplashes;
and it was pitiful to see David, with his bleeding
hands on the wheel, stolidly shaking his head as
the spray cut him.</p>

<p>He had been on deck for forty hours, buffeted by
the huge waves, and he was covered with salt-water
boils. His feet were flayed and frozen, and his hands
so gashed that he dared not close or rest them, lest
the agony of unclasping or moving them again should
make him lose his consciousness. He feared, also,
that his feet were so badly frozen that he would never
be able to walk on them any more. These miseries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
others were sharing with him; but David had been
struck by a falling spar at the beginning of the storm,
and there was now an abscess forming on his lung that
tortured him beyond his usual speechless patience.
&#8220;God pity me!&#8221; he moaned. &#8220;God pity me!&#8221;</p>

<p>When the storm ceased the <i>Elizabeth</i> was as bare as
a newly launched hull, and wallowing like a soaked
log. David had fallen forward on his face, and was
asleep or insensible. He did not hear the handspike
thumped upon the deck, and the cry, &#8220;<i>On deck! on
deck! Lord help us! she is going down!</i>&#8221; But some
one lifted him on to a raft which had been hastily
lashed together, and the misery that followed was
only a part of some awful hours when physical pain
from head to feet drove him to the verge of madness.
He never knew how long it was before they were met
by the <i>Alert</i>, a large passenger packet going into the
port of London, and taken on board. Four of the men
were then dead from exhaustion, and the physician on
the <i>Alert</i> looked doubtfully at David&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is dying,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and why give him
further pain?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a young man stepped forward and looked at
David. There was both pity and liking in his face,
and he stooped, and said something in the dying man&#8217;s
ear. A faint smile answered the words; and the youth
spoke to the doctor, and both of them went to work
with a will. The effort, even then so desperate, was
ere long complicated by fever and delirium, and when
David came to himself it was almost like a new birth.
He was weaker than an infant&#8211;too weak, indeed, to
wonder or speculate, or even remember.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>He only knew that he was in a large room and that
two men were with him. One was at his bedside,
quiet and drowsy; the other was reading in a Bible,
sitting close by the shaded candle. David knew it was
a Bible. Who does not know a Bible, even afar off?
No matter how it may be bound, the book has a homely
and familiar look that no other book has. David shut
his eyes again after seeing it; he felt as safe and happy
as if a dear friend had spoken to him. And in a few
days the man with the Bible began to come near him,
and to read softly the most tender and gracious words
he could find in that tenderest of all books.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of an interval of delicious
rest to David. It was as if some strong angel swung
and hushed and wrapped him in a drowsy, blissful
torpor. He felt no pain, not even in his tortured feet,
and his hands lay at rest upon the white coverlet,
healed of all their smarting and aching. For once in
his hard life they were not tired or sore. He knew
that he was fed and turned, that his pillows were made
soft and cool, and that there was the vague sense of
kind presence about him; that sometimes he heard,
like a heavenly echo, words of comfort that he seemed
to have heard long ago; that he slept and wakened,
and slept again, with a conscious pleasure in the transitions.</p>

<p>And he asked no questions. He was content to let
life lie in blissful quiescence, to be still, and keep his
eyes closed to the world, and his ears deaf to its cries.
Gradually these sensations increased in strength. One
day he heard his nurse say that it would be well to
remove him into an entirely fresh room. And he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
knew that he was lifted in strong arms, and anon
breathed a clearer atmosphere, and slept a life-giving
sleep. When he awoke he had new strength. He
voluntarily opened his eyes, and saw a tree waving
branches covered with fresh, crinkly leaves before his
window. It was like a glimpse of heaven. And that
afternoon his preserver came to his side and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee is much better. Can thee listen to me now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David looked at the young man and smiled;
and their eyes met, and their hands met, and the well
man stooped to the sick man and kissed his cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Friend John Priestly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What is
thy name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David&#8211;David Borson&#8211;Shetland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David, thee is going to live. That is good news,
is it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; life is hard&#8211;cruel hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but thee can say, &#8216;The Lord is mine helper.&#8217;
Thee can pray now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If thee cannot speak, lift up thy hand. He will
see it and answer thee.&#8221;</p>

<p>And David&#8217;s face shadowed, and he did not lift up
his hand; also, if the whisper in his heart had been
audible, John Priestly would have heard him say,
&#8220;What is the use of prayer? The Lord has cast me
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>But John did not try the strength of his patient
further at that time. He sat by his side, and laid his
hand upon David&#8217;s hand, and began to repeat in a
slow, assuring voice the One Hundred and Third
Psalm. Its familiar words went into David&#8217;s ears like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
music, and he fell sweetly asleep to its promises. For,
though men in their weakness and haste are apt to
say, &#8220;The Lord hath forgotten to be gracious,&#8221; they
who have but once felt his love, though dimly and far
off, cannot choose but trust in it, even to the grave.</p>

<p>And souls fraternize in their common exile. John
Priestly loved the young man whom he had saved, and
David felt his love. As he came fully back to life the
past came clearly back to memory. He remembered
Nanna as those who love white jasmine remember it
when its starry flowers are gone&#8211;with a sweet, aching
longing for their beauty and perfume. He remembered
those terrible days when physical pain had
been acute in every limb and every nerve, when he
had fainted with agony, but never complained. He
remembered his lonely journey to the grave&#8217;s mouth,
and the dim human phantoms who had stood, as it
were, afar off, and helped and cheered him as best they
could. And he understood that he had really been
born again: a new lease of life had been granted him,
and he had come back to earth, as so many wish to
come back, with all his old loves and experiences to
help him in the future.</p>

<p>If only God would love him! If only God would
give him ever so small a portion of his favor! If he
would only let him live humbly before him, with such
comfort of home and friends as a poor fisherman might
have! He wondered, as he lay still, what he or his
fathers had done that he should be so sorely punished.
Perhaps he had shown too great partiality to his
father&#8217;s memory in the matter of Bele Trenby. Well,
then, he must bear the consequences; for even at this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
hour he could not make up his mind to blame his
father more than his father had blamed himself.</p>

<p>And as he lay watching the waving of the green
trees, and inhaling the scent of the lilies and violets
from the garden below him, he began to think of
Shetland with a great longing. The bare, brown,
treeless land called him with a hundred voices, and
thoughts of Nanna came like a small bird winging the
still, blue air. For sorrow can endear a place as well
as joy; and the little hut on the bare moor, in which
he could see Nanna working at her braiding or her
knitting, was the spot on all the earth that drew his
soul with an irresistible desire.</p>

<p>Oh, how he wanted to see Nanna! Oh, how he
wanted to see her! Just to hold her hand, and kiss
her face, and sit by her side for an hour or two! He
did not wish either her conscience or his own less
tender, but he thought that now, perhaps, they might
be cousins and friends, and so comfort and help each
other in the daily trials of their hard, lonely lives.</p>

<p>One day, when he was much stronger, as he sat
by the open window thinking of these things, John
Priestly came to read to him. John had a faculty of
choosing the sweetest and most comfortable portions
of the Book in his hand. This selection was not without
purpose. He had learned from David&#8217;s delirious
complainings the intense piety of the youth, and the
spiritual despair which had intensified his sufferings.
And he hoped God, through him, would say a word of
comfort to the sorrowful heart. So he chose, with the
sweet determination of love, the most glorious and the
most abounding words of the divine Father.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>David listened with a reserved acceptance. It was
in a measure a new Scripture to him. It appeared
partial. When John read, with a kind of triumph,
that the Lord &#8220;is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing
that <i>any</i> should perish, but that <i>all</i> should come to
repentance,&#8221; David made a slight movement of dissent;
and John asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Is not that a noble love? Thee believes in it,
David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word was softly but positively uttered.</p>

<p>&#8220;What then, David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Some men and angels are predestined unto everlasting
life, and others foreordained to everlasting
death; and their number is so certain and definite
that it cannot be either increased or diminished.&#8217;&#8221;
And David quoted these words from the Confession of
Faith with such confidence and despair that John
trembled at them.</p>

<p>&#8220;David! David!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Jesus Christ came to
seek and to save the lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is impossible for the lost to be saved,&#8221; answered
David, with a somber confidence; &#8220;only the elect,
predestined to salvation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the rest of mankind, David? what of them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God has been pleased to ordain them to wrath,
that his justice may be satisfied and glorified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;David, who made thee such a God as this? Where
did thee learn about him? How can thee love him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is in the Confession of Faith. And, oh, John
Priestly, I do love him! Yes, I love him, though he has
hid his face from me and, I fear, cast me off forever.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>&#8220;Dear heart,&#8221; said John, &#8220;thee is wronging thy
best Friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could think so! Oh, if I could think so!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, as we are inquiring after God, and
nothing less, is it not fair to take him at his own
word?&#8221;</p>

<p>David looked inquiringly at John, but made no
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean, will it not be more just to believe what
God says of himself than to believe what men,&#8211;priests,&#8211;long
ago dead, have said about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, one after another, the golden verses, full of
God&#8217;s love, dropped from John&#8217;s lips in a gracious
shower. And David was amazed, and withal a little
troubled. John was breaking up all his foundations
for time and for eternity. He was using the Scriptures
to grind to powder the whole visible church as David
understood it. It was a kind of spiritual shipwreck.
His slow nature took fire gradually, and then burned
fiercely. Weak as he was, he could not sit still. John
Priestly was either a voice in the wilderness crying
&#8220;Peace!&#8221; and &#8220;Blessing!&#8221; to him, or he was the voice
of a false prophet crying &#8220;Peace!&#8221; where there was
no peace. He looked into the face of this new preacher,
frank and glowing as it was, with inquiry not unmixed
with suspicion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;if these things be so, let
God speak to me. Bring me a Bible with large letters.
I want to see these words with my eyes, and touch
them with my fingers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation thus begun was constantly continued,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
and David searched the Scriptures from morning
to night. Often, as the spring grew fairer and
warmer, the two young men sat in the garden with
the Bible between them; and while the sunshine fell
brightly on its pages they reasoned together of fate
and free will, and of that divine mercy which is from
everlasting to everlasting. For where young men
have leisure spiritual things employ them much more
frequently than is supposed. Indeed, it is the young
who are most earnestly troubled about the next life;
the middle-aged are too busy with this one, and the
aged do not speculate, because they will soon know.</p>

<p>Thus, daily, little by little, through inlets and broader
ways known only to God and himself, the light grew
and grew unto perfect day, and flooded not only the
great hills and promontories of his soul, but also shone
into all its secret caves and gloomy valleys and lonely
places. Then David knew how blind and ignorant he
had been; then he was penetrated with loving amazement,
and humbled to the dust with a sense of the
wrong he had done the Father of his spirit; and he
locked himself in his room, and fell down on his face
before his God. But into that awful communion, in
which so much was confessed and so much forgiven,
it is not lawful to inquire.</p>

<p>After this the thought of Nanna became
an irresistible longing. He could not be
happy until she sat in the sunshine of
God&#8217;s love with him. He went into the
garden and tested his strength, and as
soon as he was in the open air he was smitten with a
homesickness not to be controlled. He wanted the
sea; he wanted the great North Sea; he longed to feel
the cradling of its salt waves under him; and the idea
of a schooner reefed down closely, and charging along
over the stormy waters, took possession of him. Then
he remembered the fishermen he used to know&#8211;the
fishermen who peopled the desolate places of the
Shetland seas.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go home!&#8221; he said with a soft, eager passion.
&#8220;I must go home to Shetland.&#8221; And there was
in his voice and accent that pride and tenderness with
which one&#8217;s home should be mentioned in a strange
land.</p>

<p>When he saw John next he told him so, and they
began to talk of his life there. John had never asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
him of his past. He knew him to be a child of God,
however far away from his Father, and he had accepted
his spiritual brotherhood with trustfulness. He understood
that it was David&#8217;s modesty that had made him
reticent. But when David was ready to leave he also
felt that John had a right to know what manner of
man he had befriended. So, as they sat together that
night, David began his history.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in the boats at six years old,&#8221; he said; &#8220;for
there was always something I could do. During the
night-fishing, unless I went with father, I was alone;
and I had hours of such awful terrors that I am
sad only to remember them; it was better to freeze
out on the sea, if father would let me go with him. I
was often hungry and often weary; I had toothaches
and earaches that I never spoke of; I was frequently
so sleepy that I fell down in the boat. And I had no
mother to kiss me or pity me, and the neighbors were
shy and far off. Father was not cross or unkind; he
just did not understand. Even in those days I wondered
why God made little lads to be so miserable and
to suffer so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke then in a very guarded way about that
revelation in the boat, for he felt rebuked for his want
of faith in it; and he said sorrowfully, as he left the
subject, &#8220;Why, then, should God send angels to men?
They are feared of them while they are present, and
they doubt them when they are gone away. He sent
one to comfort me, and I denied it to my own heart;
yes, even though I sorely needed the comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he took John to Shetland with him. He
showed him, in strong, simple words, the old Norse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
town, with its gray skies and its gray seas, and its
fishing-smacks hanging to the rushing sides of foaming
mountains. He described the hoary cliffs and
their world of sea-birds, the glorious auroras, the
heavenly summers, and the deadly chillness of the
winter fogs as one drift after another passed in dim
and desolate majesty over the sea and land.</p>

<p>Slowly and with some hesitation he got to Nanna in
her little stone hut, braiding her straw and nursing
her crippled baby. The tears came into his eyes, he
clasped his knees with his hands as if to steady himself,
while he spoke rapidly of her marriage with Nicol
Sinclair, the drowning of her father and brothers,
the cruelty of her husband, his desertion, his return,
Nanna&#8217;s terror of losing Vala, the fatal typhus, her
desolation, and her spiritual anguish about Vala&#8217;s condition.
All these things he told John with that
powerful eloquence which is born of living, intense
feeling.</p>

<p>John was greatly moved by the whole simple, tragic
story, but he spoke only on the last topic, for it seemed
to him to dwarf all other sorrow. It roused his indignation,
and he said it was a just and holy anger.
He wondered how men, and especially mothers, could
worship a God who was supposed to damn little children
before they were born. He vowed that neither
Moloch nor Baal, nor any pagan deity, had been so
brutal. He was amazed that ministers believing such
a doctrine dared to marry. What special right had
they to believe their children would all be elect? And
if there was a shadow of doubt on this subject, how
awful was their responsibility! Nanna&#8217;s scruples, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
said, were the only possible outcome of a conscientious,
unselfish soul believing the devilish doctrine. And he
cried out with enthusiasm:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanna is to be honored! Oh, for a conscience as
tender and void of offense toward God! I will go to
Shetland and kiss the hem of her garment! She is a
woman in ten thousand!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said David, softly, &#8220;I shall take comfort
to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To think,&#8221; said John, who was still moved by a
holy anger, &#8220;to think that God should have created
this beautiful world as a nursery for hell! that he
should have made such a woman as Nanna to suckle
devils! No, no, David!&#8221; he said, suddenly calming
himself; &#8220;thee could never believe such things of thy
God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was taught them early and late. I can say the
Confession of Faith backward, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let no man-made creed impose itself on thee,
David&#8211;enter into thee, and possess thee, and take the
place of thy soul. The voice that spoke from Sinai
and from Bethlehem is still speaking. And man&#8217;s
own soul is an oracle, if he will only listen to it&#8211;the
inward, instant sense of a present God, and of his
honorable, true, and only Son Christ Jesus.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will listen, if God will speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never thee mind catechisms and creeds and confessions.
The Word of God was before them, and the
Word will be the Word when catechisms and confessions
are cast into the dusty museums of ancient
things, with all the other shackles of the world in
bondage. David, there is in every good man a spiritual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
center, answering to a higher spiritual center in
the universe. All controversies come back to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish, John Priestly, that you could see Nanna,
and speak comfort to her heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That must be thy message, David. And be sure
that thee knows well the children&#8217;s portion in the
Scriptures. Thee must show Nanna that <i>theirs is the
kingdom</i>. What we win through great tribulation they
inherit through the love of the Father. <i>Theirs is the
kingdom</i>; and there is no distinction of elect or non-elect,
as I read the title.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I count the hours now until I am able to travel.
I long for the sea that stretches nor&#8217;ard to the ice, and
the summer days, when the sunset brightens the midnight.
No need to egg me on. I am all the time
thinking of the old town growing out of the mist, and
I know how I shall feel when I stand on the pier again
among the fishers, when I hurry through the clean,
quiet streets, while the kind people nod and smile, and
call to each other, &#8216;Here is David Borson come back
again.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Nanna?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is the heart of my longing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And thee is taking her glad tidings of great joy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am that. So there is great hurry in my heart,
for I like not to sit in the sunshine and know that
Nanna is weeping in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thee must not be discouraged if she be at first
unable to believe thy report.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hour will come. Nanna was ever a seeker
after God. She will listen joyfully. She will take the
cup of salvation, and drink it with thanksgiving. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
shall stand together in the light, loving God and fearing
God, but not afraid of him. Faith in Christ will
set her free.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But lean hard upon God&#8217;s Word, David. There
is light enough and help enough for every strait of
life in it. Let thy creed lie at rest. There are many
doors to scientific divinity, but there is only one door
to heaven. And I will tell thee this thing, David: if
men had to be good theologians before they were good
Christians, the blessed heaven would be empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet, John, my theology was part of my very life.
Nothing to me was once more certain than that men
and women were in God&#8217;s hand as clay in the potter&#8217;s.
And as some vessels are made to honor, and some to
dishonor, so some men were made for salvation and
honor, and others for rejection and dishonor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clay in the potter&#8217;s hand! And some for honor,
and some for dishonor! We will even grant that
much; but tell me, David, does the potter ever make
his vessels for <i>the express purpose of breaking them</i>?
No, no, David! He is not willing that <i>any</i> should
perish. Christ is not going to lose what he has bought
with his blood. The righteous are planted as trees by
the watercourses, but God does not plant any tree for
fuel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a good God, and his name is Love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So, then, thee is going back to Shetland with glad
tidings for many a soul. What will thy hands find to
do for thy daily bread?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall go back to the boats and the nets and lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would thee like to have a less dangerous way of
earning thy bread? My father has a great business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
in the city, and thee could drive one of the big drays
that go to the docks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could not. I can carry a ship through any sea
a ship can live in; I could not drive a Shetland shelty
down an empty street. I am only a simple sea-dog.
I love the sea. Men say for sure it is in my heart
and my blood. I must live on the sea. When my
hour comes to die, I hope the sea will keep my body
in one of her clean, cool graves. If God gives me
Nanna, and we have sons and daughters, they shall
have a happy childhood and a good schooling. Then
I will put all the boys in the boats, and the girls shall
learn to grow like their mother, and, if it please God,
they shall marry good men and good fishers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that the life of a fisher is a very
hard one, and withal that it hath but small returns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fishers have their good and their bad seasons.
They take their food direct from the hand of God; so,
then, good or bad, it is all right. Fishers have their
loves and joys and sorrows; birth and marriage and
death come to them as to others. They have the same
share of God&#8217;s love, the same Bible, the same hope of
eternal life, that the richest men and women have. It
is enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And hard lives have their compensations, David.
Doubtless the fisherman&#8217;s life has its peculiar blessings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has. The fisher&#8217;s life is as free from temptation
as a life can be. He <i>has</i> to trust God a great deal; if
he did not he would very seldom go into the boats at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet he holds the ocean &#8216;in the hollow of his hand.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>&#8220;That is true. I never feel so surely held in the
hollow of his hand as when the waves are as high as
my masthead, and my boat smashes into the black pit
below. There is none but God then. Thank you,
Friend John, but I shall live and die a fisherman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would thee care to change Shetland for some
warmer and less stormy climate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would a man care to change his own father and
mother for any other father and mother? Stern and
hard was my poor father, and he knew not how to
love; but his memory is dear to me, and I would not
break the tie between us&#8211;no, not to be the son of a
king! My native land is a poor land, but I have
thought of her green and purple moors among gardens
full of roses. Shetland is my <i>home</i>, and home is sweet
and fair and dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Traveling Zionward, David, we have often to walk
in the wilderness. Thee hast dwelt in Skye and in
Shetland; what other lands hast thee seen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been east as far as Smyrna. I sat there
and read the message of &#8216;the First and the Last&#8217; to its
church. And I went to Athens, and stood where St.
Paul had once stood. And I have seen Rome and
Naples and Genoa and Marseilles, and many of the
Spanish and French ports. I have pulled oranges from
the trees, and great purple grapes from the vines, and
even while I was eating them longed for the oat-cakes
and fresh fish of Shetland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rome and Naples and Athens! Then, David, thee
hast seen the fairest cities on the earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, Friend John, what hells I saw in them!
I was taken through great buildings where men and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
women die of dreadful pain. I saw other buildings
where men and women could eat and sleep, and could
not think or love or know. I saw drinking-hells and
gambling-hells. I saw men in dark and awful prisons,
men living in poverty and filth and blasphemy,
without hope for this world or the next. I saw men
die on the scaffold. And, John, I have often wondered
if this world were hell. Are we put here in low, or
lower, or lowest hell to work out our salvation, and so
at last, through great tribulation, win our weary way
back to heaven?&#8221;</p>

<p>John Priestly was silent a few moments ere he answered:
&#8220;If that were even so, there is still comfort,
David. For if we make our bed in any of such hells,&#8211;mind,
<i>we</i> make it,&#8211;even there we are not beyond
the love and the pity of the Infinite One. For when
the sorrows of hell compassed David of old, he cried
unto God, and he delivered him from his strong enemy,
and brought him forth into a large place. So, then,
David, though good men may get into hell, they do
not need to stay there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that by experience, John. Have I not
been in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps, in
that lowest hell of the soul where I had no God to
pray to? For how could I pray to a God so cruel
that I did not dare to become a father, lest he should
elect my children to damnation? a God so unjust that
he loved without foresight of faith or good works, and
hated because it was his pleasure to hate, and to ordain
the hated to dishonor and wrath?&#8221;<a id='FNanchor_4'></a><a href='#Footnote_4' class='fnanchor'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, David?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>&#8220;In my distress my soul cried out, &#8217;<i>God pity me!
God pity me!</i>&#8217; And even while I so wronged him he
sent from above&#8211;he sent you, John; he took me, he
drew me out of many waters,&#8211;for great was his mercy
toward me,&#8211;and he delivered my soul from the lowest
hell.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span><a id='link_12'></a>XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>&#8220;AT LAST IT IS PEACE&#8221;</span></h2>

<p>A week after this conversation David was
near Lerwick. It was very early in the
morning, and the sky was gray and the
sea was gray, and through the vapory
veiling the little town looked gray and
silent as a city in a dream. During the voyage he had
thought of himself always as hastening at once to
Nanna&#8217;s house, but as soon as his feet touched the
quay he hesitated. The town appeared to be asleep;
there was only here and there a thin column of peat
smoke from the chimneys, and the few people going
about their simple business in the misty morning were
not known to him. Probably, also, he had some unreasonable
expectation, for he looked sadly around,
and, sighing, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure, such a thing would never happen, except
in a dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>After all, it seemed best that he should go first to
Barbara Traill&#8217;s. She would give him a cup of tea,
and while he drank it he could send one of Glumm&#8217;s
little lads with a message to Nanna. There was nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
of cowardice in this determination; it was rather
that access of reverential love which, as it draws nearer,
puts its own desire and will at the feet of the beloved
one.</p>

<p>Barbara&#8217;s door stood open, and she was putting
fresh fuel under the hanging tea-kettle. The smell of
the peat smoke was homely and pleasant to David;
he sniffed it eagerly as he called out:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, mother, good morning!&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised herself quickly, and turned her broad,
kind face to him. A strange shadow crossed it when
she saw David, but she answered affectionately:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, David, here we meet again!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she hastened the morning meal, and as she
did so asked question after question about his welfare
and adventures, until David said a little impatiently:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is enough of this talk, mother. Speak to
me now of Nanna Sinclair. Is she well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your aunt Sabiston is dead. There was a great
funeral, I can tell you that. She has left all her
money to the kirk and the societies; and a white stone
as high as two men has come from Aberdeen for her
grave. Well, so it is. And you must know, also,
that my son has married himself, and not to my liking,
and so he has gone from me; and your room is empty
and ready, if you wish it so; and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Barbara! Keep your room for me, and
I will pay the price of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will do that gladly; and as for the price, we
shall have no words about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All this is well enough, but, mother! mother!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
what is there to hide from me? Speak with a straight
tongue. Where is Nanna?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Barbara said plainly, &#8220;Nanna is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a cry of amazed anguish David leaped to his
feet, instinctively covering his ears with his hands,
for he could not bear such words to enter them.
&#8220;<i>Dead!</i>&#8221; he whispered; and Barbara saw him reeling
and swaying like a tottering pillar. She pushed a
chair toward him, and was thankful that he had
strength left to take its support. But she made no
outcry, and called in none of the neighbors. Quietly
she stood a little way off, while David, in a death-like
silence, fought away the swooning, drowning wave
which was making his heart stand still and his limbs
fail him. For she knew the nature of the suffering
man&#8211;knew that when he came to himself there would
be none but God could intermeddle in his heart&#8217;s bitterness
and loss.</p>

<p>After a sharp struggle David opened his eyes, and
Barbara gave him a drink of cold water; but she
offered neither advice nor consolation. Only when
David said, &#8220;I am sick, mother, and I will go to my
room and lie down on my bed,&#8221; she answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear lad, that is the right way. Sleep, if sleep
you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>About sunsetting David asked Barbara for food;
and as she prepared it he sat by the open window,
silent and stupefied, dominated by the somber inertia
of hopeless sorrow. When he began to eat, Barbara
took from a china jar two papers, and gave them to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promised Nanna to put them into your hands,&#8221;
she said.</p>

ON THE WAY TO NANNA&#8217;S COTTAGE.
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>&#8220;When did she die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last December, the fourteenth day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see her on that day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was there early in the morning, for I saw
there was snow to fall. She was dead at the noon
hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You saw her go away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I was afraid of the storm. I left her at ten
o&#8217;clock. She could not then speak, but she gave me
the papers. We had talked of them before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then did she die alone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did not. I went into the next cottage and
told Christine Yell that it was the last hour with
Nanna; and she said, &#8216;I will go to her,&#8217; and so she
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have stayed, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lad, the snow was already falling, and I had
to hasten across the moor, as there was very good
reason to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David went out, and Barbara watched him
take the road that led to Nanna&#8217;s empty cottage. The
door opened readily to the lifted latch, and he entered
the forsaken room. The peat fire had long ago burned
itself to ashes. The rose-plant, which had been
Nanna&#8217;s delight, had withered away on its little shelf
by the window. But the neighbors had swept the
floor and put the simple furniture in order. David
drew the bolt across the door, and opened the papers
which Nanna had left for him. The first was a bequest
to him of the cottage and all within it; the second
was but a little slip on which the dying woman
had written her last sad messages to him:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>Oh, my love! my love! Farewell forever! I am come to the
end of my life. I am going away, and I know not where to. All
is dark. But I have cast myself at His feet, and said, &#8220;Thy will
be done!&#8221;</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<hr class='tb' />

<div class='bquote'>
<p>I am still alive, David. I have been alone all night, and
every breath has been a death-pang. How can His eternal
purpose need my bitter suffering? Oh, that God would pity
me! His will be done!</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<hr class='tb' />

<div class='bquote'>
<p>My love, it is nearly over. <i>I have seen Vala!</i> At last it is
peace&#8211;peace! His will be done! Mercy&#8211;mercy&#8211;mercy&#8211;</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>These pitiful despairs and farewells were written in
a large, childish hand, and on a poor sheet of paper.
David spread this paper upon Vala&#8217;s couch, and, kneeling
down, covered it with tears and kisses; but anon
he lifted it up toward heaven, and prayed as men pray
when they feel prayer to be an immediate and veritable
thing&#8211;when they detain God, and clasp his feet,
and cling to his robe, and will not let him go until he
bless them.</p>

<p>Christine Yell had seen David enter the cottage, and
after an hour had passed she went to the door intending
to speak to him; but she heard the solemn, mysterious
voice of the man praying, and she went away
and called her neighbors, Margaret Jarl and Elga Fae
and Thora Thorson. And they talked of David a
little, and then Magnus Thorson, the father-in-law of
Thora, being a very old man, went alone into Nanna&#8217;s
cottage to see David. And after a while the women
were called, and Christine took with her a plate of fish
and bread which she had prepared; and David was
glad of their sympathy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>They sat down outside the door. The tender touch
of the gray gloaming softened the bleak cliffs and the
brown moorland, and the heavens were filled with
stars. Then softly and solemnly Christine spoke of
Nanna&#8217;s long, hard fight with death, and of the spiritual
despair which had intensified her suffering.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was in season and out of season that she was at
Vala&#8217;s grave,&#8221; said Christine, &#8220;and kneeling and lying
on the cold ground above her; and the end was&#8211;what
could only be looked for&#8211;a cough and a fever, and
the slow consumption that wasted her away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was there none of you to comfort her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true, David, that the child was never baptized,&#8221;
said Christine; &#8220;so, then, what comfort could
there be for her? And then she began to think that
God had never loved her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to the Best, she knows now how far
wrong she was,&#8221; said David, fervently; &#8220;she knows
now that his love is from everlasting to everlasting.
Her poor heart, wearied with so many sorrows and
troubled by so many fears, has tasted one supreme
happiness&#8211;that God is love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She thought for sure that he was continually angry
with her. &#8216;If he had cared for my soul,&#8217; she said to
me, one day, &#8216;he would not have let me marry Nicol
Sinclair. He would have kept his hand about me
until my cousin David Borson came from the Hebrides.
And if he had cared for my poor bairn he would not,
by this and that, have prevented the minister coming
to baptize her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was she long ill?&#8221; asked David.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the beginning of last winter she became too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
ill to go to the ordinances, and too feared to open
her Bible, lest she should read her own condemnation
in it; and so gradually she seemed to lose all hope,
either for this life or the next one. And folk wearied
of her complaining, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The elders and the minister, did they not try to
comfort her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At first Elder Peterson and Elder Hoag came to
see her; but Nanna put strange questions to them&#8211;questions
they could not answer; and they said the
minister could not answer them, either&#8211;no, nor the
whole assembly of the kirk of Scotland. And I was
hearing that the minister was angered by her words
and her doubting, and he told her plainly &#8216;women had
no call to speer after the &#8220;why&#8221; of God&#8217;s purposes.&#8217;
And indeed, David, she was very outspoken,&#8211;for she
was fretful with pain and fever,&#8211;and she told him
that she was not thankful to go to hell for the glory
and honor of God, and that, moreover, she did not
want to go to heaven if Vala was not there. And
when the minister said, &#8216;<i>Whist</i>, woman!&#8217;&#8211;for he was
frightened at her words,&#8211;she would not be still, but
went on to wonder how fathers and mothers could be
happy, even in the very presence of God, if their sons
and daughters were wandering in the awful outer
darkness; and, moreover, she said she was not grateful
to God for life, and she thought her consent to
coming into life on such hard terms ought to have
been first asked.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Christine looked at David, and ceased speaking,
for she was afraid that her words would both
anger and trouble the young man. But David&#8217;s eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
were full of happy tears, and there was a tender smile
round his mouth. He was thinking of the glad surprises
that Nanna must have had&#8211;she who belonged
to the God of compassions. After all her shuddering
questions and lamentable doubts and cruel pain, the
everlasting arms under her; Vala and her beloved
dead to comfort her; ineffable peace; unclouded joy;
the night past; the last tear wiped away! At that
moment he felt that it was too late to weep for Nanna;
indeed, he smiled like one full of blessed thought.
And Christine, a little irritated by the unexpected
mood, did not further try to smooth over the hard
facts of the lonely woman&#8217;s death-bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The minister was angry with her, and he said
God was angry. And Nanna said, well, then, she
knew that he did not care about her perishing; it was
all one to him. A little happiness would have saved
her, and he refused her the smallest joy; and she did
not see how crushing the poor and broken-hearted in
the dust increased his glory. The minister told her
she was resisting God, and she said, no; that was not
possible. God was her master, and he smote her, and
perhaps had the right to do so; but she was not his
child: no father would treat a child so hardly as he
had treated her. She was a slave, and must submit,
and weep and die at the corner of the highway. And,
to be sure, the minister did not think of her pain and
her woman&#8217;s heart,&#8211;what men do?&#8211;and he thought it
right to speak hard words to her. And then Nanna
said she wished they would all leave her alone with
her sorrow, and so they did.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, suddenly and swiftly as a flash of light, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
word came to David. His heart burned, and his
tongue was loosened, and then and there he preached
to the old man and the three women the unsearchable
riches of the cross of Christ. He glorified God because
Nanna had learned Christ at the radiant feet of Christ,
in the joy and love of the redeemed. He took his
Bible from his pocket, and repeated all the blessed
words he had marked and learned. Until the midnight
moon climbed cold and bright to the zenith he
spoke. And old Magnus Thorson stood up, leaning
on his staff, full of holy wonder, and the women softly
sobbed and prayed at his feet. And when they parted
there was in every heart a confident acceptance of
David&#8217;s closing words:</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever rests, however feebly, on the eternal
mercy shall live forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this &#8220;call&#8221; sleep was impossible to David.
That insight which changes faith into knowledge had
comforted him concerning his dead. He lay down
on Vala&#8217;s couch, and he felt sure that Nanna&#8217;s smile
filled the silence like a spell; for there are still moments
when we have the transcendental faculties of the illuminated
who, as the apostle says, &#8220;have tasted of the
powers of the world to come&#8221;&#8211;still moments when we
feel that Jacob&#8217;s ladder yet stands between heaven and
earth, and that we can see the angels ascending and
descending upon it. He was so still that he could
hear the beating of his own heart, but clear and vivid
as light his duty spread out before him. He had
found his vocation, and, oh, how rapidly men grow
under the rays of that invisible sun!</p>

<p>The next morning he went to see the minister. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
was seated, writing his sermon, precisely as David
had found him on the occasion of his last visit. So
much had happened to David since that morning that
he found it difficult to believe nothing had happened
to the minister. He looked up at the interruption
with the same slight annoyance, but the moment he
saw David his manner changed. He rose up quickly
and went to meet him, and as he clasped his hand
looked with curious intentness into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are much changed, David,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What
has happened to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything, nearly, minister. The David Borson
who left here two years ago is dead and buried. I
have been born again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a great experience. Sit down and tell me
about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, minister, but first I must speak of Nanna
Sinclair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is dead, David; that is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone home. She has gone to the God
who loved her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;hope so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it is so. Nanna loved God, and those
who love God in life will find no difficulty in going to
him after life is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She had a hard life, and it was all in the dark to
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But at the death-hour it was light, though the
light was not of this world.&#8221; And David told the
minister about the farewell message she had written
him, and its final happy words, &#8220;<i>At last it is peace&#8211;peace!</i>&#8221;
He could not bear that any eyes should see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
the paper, or any hand touch it, but his own; but he
wished all to know that at the death-hour God had
comforted her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She suffered a great deal, David.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ailed her, minister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ails the lamp, David, when it goes out?
There is no oil, that is all. Nanna used up all her
strength in weeping and feeling; the oil of life wastes
quickly in that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O minister, I am so sorry that I left her! It was
selfish and cruel. I wish now that I could cover her
hands with kisses, and ask her pardon on my knees;
but I find nothing but a grave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, David, it is death that forces us to see the selfishness
that comes into our best affections. Self permitted
you to give all you had to Nanna, but forbade
you to give yourself. There was self even in your
self-surrender to God. If you could have seen that
long, long disappointed look in Nanna&#8217;s eyes, and the
pale lips that asked so little from you&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O minister, spare me! She asked only, &#8216;Stay near
me, David&#8217;; and I might have stayed and comforted
her to the end. Oh, for one hour&#8211;one hour only!
But neither to-day nor to-morrow, nor through all
eternity, shall I have the opportunity to love and
soothe which I threw away because it hurt me and
made my heart ache.&#8221; And David bowed his head in
his hands and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Alas! love, irreparably wronged, possesses these
eternal memories; and the soul, forced to weep for
opportunities gone forever, has these inconsolable refinements
of tenderness. &#8220;One hour&#8211;one hour only!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
was the cry of David&#8217;s soul. And the answer was,
&#8220;No, never! She has carried away her sorrow. You
may, indeed, meet her where all tears are dried and
forgotten; but while she did weep you were not there;
you had left her alone, and your hour to comfort her
has gone forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a short silence the minister went to his desk,
and brought from it David&#8217;s purse, and he laid it, with
the will that had been written, before him. &#8220;It is
useless now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Nanna has need of nothing
you can give her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it do any good, minister?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a great deal. When Nanna was no longer
able to come to the kirk, I went to see her. She was
miserably sick and poor, and it made my heart ache
to watch her thin, trembling fingers trying to knit. I
took her work gently out of her hands, and said, &#8216;You
are not able to hold the needles, Nanna, and you have
no need to try to do so. There is provision made for
all your wants.&#8217; And she flared up like whin-bushes
set on fire, and said she had asked neither kirk nor
town for help, and that she trusted in God to deliver
her from this life before she had to starve or take a
beggar&#8217;s portion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O minister, if God had not comforted me concerning
her, you would break my heart. What did you
say to the dear woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said, &#8216;It is neither kirk nor town nor almsgivers
that have provided for your necessity, Nanna; it is
your cousin David Borson.&#8217; And when she heard
your name she began to cry, &#8217;<i>O David! David!</i>&#8217;
And after I had let her weep awhile I said, &#8216;You will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
let your cousin do for you at this hour, Nanna?&#8217; And
she answered, &#8216;Oh, yes; I will take any favor from
David. It was like him to think of me. Oh, that he
would come back!&#8217; So I sent her every week ten
shillings until she died, and then I saw that she was
decently laid beside her mother and her little child;
and I paid all expenses from the money you left.
There is a reckoning of them in the papers. Count it,
with the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not count after you, minister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, David, God has counted between us. It is
all right to the last bawbee. Now tell where you have
been, and what you have seen and suffered; for it is
written on your face that you have seen many hard days.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then David told all about his wanderings and his
shipwreck, and the mercy of God to him through his
servant John Priestly. But when he tried to speak
of the new revelation of the gospel that had come to
him, he found his lips closed. The fire that had
burned on them the night before, when he spoke
under the midnight sky to the old fisherman and the
fisherwives, was dead and cold, and he could not kindle
it; so he said to himself, &#8220;It is not yet the hour.&#8221;
And he went out of the manse without telling one of
all the glorious things he had resolved to tell. Neither
was he troubled by the omission. He could wait
God&#8217;s time. God, who has made the heart, can always
touch the heart, but he felt that just then his words
would irritate rather than move; besides, it was not
necessary for him to speak unless he got the message.
He could not constrain another soul, but there was
One who led by invisible cords.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>As they stood a moment at the manse door the
minister said, &#8220;Your aunt Sabiston has gone the way
of all flesh.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard tell,&#8221; answered David. &#8220;How did she
go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like herself&#8211;grim and steadfast to the last. She
would not take to her bed; she met death in her chair.
When the doctor told her Death was in the room, she
stood up, and welcomed him to her house, and said, &#8216;I
have long been waiting for your release.&#8217; I tried to
talk to her, but she told me to my face that I had
nothing to do with her soul. &#8216;If I am lost, I am lost,&#8217;
she said; &#8216;and if I am chosen, who shall lay anything
to the charge of God&#8217;s elect?&#8217; She said she believed
herself to be the child of God, and that, though she
had made some sore stumbles and been fractious and
ill to guide, she had done no worse than many of his
well-loved bairns, and she expected no worse welcome
home. &#8216;I have been long away, minister,&#8217; she sighed,
&#8216;getting on to a century away, and I&#8217;ll be glad to win
home again.&#8217; And those were her last words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God be merciful to her! In this world, I think,
she was an unjust and cruel woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was so, then, without moral disquietude. The
sin had got into her soul, and she was comfortable
with it. God is her judge. He only knew her aright.
She left her money wisely and for good ends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard tell, to the kirk and the societies and
the freedom fund. Yet she had kinsfolk in the Orkneys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all very rich. They went to lawyers
about her property, but Mistress Sabiston had made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
all too fast and sure for any one to alter. She was a
woman that would have her way, dead or alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, this time, it seems, her way is a good
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this David settled his life very much on the
old lines. He went to live in Nanna&#8217;s cottage, and
returned to the boats and the fishing with Groat&#8217;s sons.
As for his higher duty, that vocation that had come to
him on that blessed night when God opened his mouth
and he spoke wonderful and gracious things of his
law, he was never for a moment recreant to it. But
the kingdom of God frequently comes without observation.
To preach a sermon, that was a thing far
outside David&#8217;s possibilities. The power of the church,
and its close and exclusive privileges, were at that
day in Shetland papal in prerogative. David never
dreamed of encroaching on them; nor, indeed, would
public opinion have permitted him to do so.</p>

<p>As it was, there grew gradually a feeling of unrest
about David. Though he was humble and devout in
all kirk exercises, it was known that the people gathered
round him not only in his own cottage, but at Groat&#8217;s
and Barbara Traill&#8217;s, and that he spoke to them of the
everlasting gospel as never man had spoken before to
them. It was known that when the boats lay stilly
rocking on the water, waiting for the &#8220;take,&#8221; David,
sitting among his mates, reasoned with them on the
love of God, until every face of clay flushed with a
radiance quite different from mere color&#8211;a radiance
that was a direct spiritual emanation, a shining of the
soul through mere matter. And as these men were
all theologians in a measure, with their &#8220;creed&#8221; and
&#8220;evidences&#8221; at their tongues&#8217; end, it was a wonderful
joy to watch their doubts, like the needle verging to
the pole, tremble and tremble into certainty.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<a id='link_i11'></a><img src='images/i237.png'  alt='' />
<p class='center caption'>
&#8220;WENT IN AND OUT AMONG HIS MATES.&#8221;
</p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>In about three years such opposition as David roused
was strong enough to induce the kirk to consider his
behavior. The minister sent for him, and in the privacy
of his study David&#8217;s opportunity came at last.
For he spoke so eloquently and mightily of the mercy
of the Infinite One that the minister covered his face,
and when the young man ceased speaking, he looked
tenderly at him, and sent him away with his blessing.
And afterward he said to the elders:</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing to call a session anent. David
Borson has been to the school of Christ, and he is
learned in the Scriptures. We will not silence him,
lest haply we be found to be fighting against God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus for many a year David went in and out among
his mates and friends, living the gospel in their sight.
The memory of Nanna filled his heart; he loved no
other woman, but every desolate and sorrowful woman
found in him a friend and a helper. And he drew the
little children like a magnet. He was the elder brother
of every boy and girl who claimed his love; his hands
were ever ready to help them, his heart was ever ready
to love them. And in such blessed service he grew
nobly aged.</p>

<p>He had come to Shetland when the islands were
very far off, when the Norse element ruled them, and
the Christianized men and women of the sagas dwelt
alone in the strong, quaint stone houses they had built.
He lived to see the influx of the southern race and
influences, the coming of modern travel and civilization;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
but he never altered his life, for in its simple,
pious dignity it befitted any era.</p>

<p>Now, it is noticeable that good men very often have
their desire about the manner of their death. And
God so favored his servant David Borson. He went
out alone one day in his boat, and a sudden storm
came up from the northeast. He did not return.
Some said there had been no time to take in the boat&#8217;s
sail, and that she must have gone down with her canvas
blowing; others thought she had become unmanageable
and drifted into some of the dangerous &#8220;races&#8221;
near the coast.</p>

<p>But, this manner or that manner, David went to
heaven as he desired, &#8220;by the way of the sea,&#8221; and
God found his body a resting-place among its cool,
clean graves&#8211;a sepulcher that no man knoweth of,
nor shall know until the mighty angel sets his right
foot upon the sea, and swears that there shall &#8220;be time
no longer.&#8221;</p>
